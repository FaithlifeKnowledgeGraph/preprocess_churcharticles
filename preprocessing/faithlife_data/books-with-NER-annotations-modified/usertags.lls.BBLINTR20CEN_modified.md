# Preface

The history of the church is the history of the church’s interpretation of the Bible.
So in order to understand and appreciate contemporary evangelicalism one must become acquainted with modern evangelical biblical interpreters.
With that belief in view this volume features thirty-five twentieth-century evangelical scholars.
Its purpose is to provide basic information about certain influential evangelical interpreters of the Bible.
This includes biographical facts, theological development, scholarly contribution, and personal evaluation.
The reader may be curious to know what criteria were used in making the selections.
Before stating the criteria, we need to answer the more fundamental question, What is evangelicalism anyway?
This movement is the subject of much study, and no simple answer will do.
Everyone seems to know, in some intuitive kind of way, what evangelicalism is.
But when it comes to articulating the essence of this movement, no two definitions are exactly alike.
They run the spectrum from the very broad understanding of evangelicalism as synonymous with Protestantism to some very specific formulations that entail acceptance of a lengthy list of precise theological statements.
Various middle positions define evangelicalism as commitment to the tenets of historical orthodoxy.
[David Bebbington](bio.davidbebbington), in an excellent volume titled Evangelicalism in Modern Britain, speaks of the “enormous variation in Evangelicalism over time” in his country.  
 The same holds true for America as well.  
 For along the way considerations in the areas of sociology, economics, philosophy, and even matters of personal style have made a single comprehensive definition of evangelicalism even more elusive.
For all of the complicating factors, however, a feeling remained that evangelicalism could still be roughly defined and understood.
The uncertainties obviously did not stop books from being written on the subject!
Having to make a decision, we opted for a middle-of-the-road definition.
Too broad a definition would have meant that almost anyone could be included.
Too narrow a definition would have meant that certain people would be left out.
So rather than enter into a complex and, for our purposes, unnecessary discussion as to the exact nature of evangelicalism, we opted for a definition somewhat more on the broad rather than on the narrow side.
That we have included biblical interpreters who by some definitions are not solidly evangelical goes without saying, but our purpose has been to allow for the inclusion of biblical interpreters who have had a marked influence on the evangelical movement and considered themselves evangelical, even if not everyone agreed.
In the end, the reader will have to decide.
Once the basic question was for all practical purposes settled, we established some criteria for deciding which biblical interpreters to include in our list: 4. Twentieth-century figures (i.e., for a biblical interpreter to be included, at least part of his career must have taken place in the twentieth century) 5. Representatives from both halves of the century (i.e., pre- and post- 1950) 6. Identification with the evangelical movement 7. Significant influence on or in the evangelical movement 8. Representatives of various denominational points of view; these include (a) Arminian/Wesleyan, (b) Calvinist/Reformed, (c) charismatic, (d) dispensationalist, (e) Lutheran, (f) Baptist, and (g) Anglican (of course, some of these categories may overlap) 9. Major interest in biblical studies rather than systematic theology
By using these criteria we were able to come up with a fairly good cross section of evangelicalism in the twentieth century.
We knew at the outset that not everyone could be included and that some systematic theologians would eminently qualify.
(And some declined to be featured in this volume.)
But our criteria were set, and the choices made.
There might be legitimate discussion about some biblical scholars who have not been included in this volume, but we doubt that many would exclude those who have been.
The next task was to choose writers for the various articles.
It would have made excellent sense to have some of our subjects write on the earlier biblical interpreters.
But that seemed too ingrown an idea.
So we decided, with but one exception, not to have anyone who was being written about write on someone else.
That settled, where it was possible we chose people who were in one way or another close to the scholar being written about.
For example, [Donald Hagner](bio.donaldhagner) had revised [George Ladd](bio.georgeeldonladd)’s Theology of the New Testament, and [Walter Elwell](bio.walteraelwell)’s position at Wheaton College made [Merrill Tenney](bio.MerrillCTenney)’s literary output readily accessible.
We hoped that this would provide a sense of immediacy and freshness to the essays.
It is a sad fact that our biblical interpreters are probably little more than names to members of the younger generation.
This volume can introduce them to venerable scholars now gone, but also to those of our own generation, who are shaping biblical studies today.
Such is our aim at any rate.
We offer these essays with the hope that the evangelical biblical interpreters will be understood better, and that evangelicalism will be strengthened as a result.

# [John Charles Ryle](bio.jcryle)/[Peter Toon](bio.petertoon)

[John Charles Ryle](bio.jcryle) ended his long service in the ordained ministry in the Church of England as the first bishop of the new diocese of Liverpool (1880–1900).
Though he had a fine mind and preached at Oxford and Cambridge Universities, he was not an academic theologian at heart.
He deliberately cultivated a popular and simple style of presentation in order to teach and defend the biblical faith of the Church of England as it is expressed in the Thirty-nine Articles.
He was perfectly content to use the Book of Common Prayer (1662) and to defend as thoroughly biblical this form of public worship and daily prayer.
He wrote many tracts and books; several of the latter, containing biblical exposition and Calvinist theology, have remained in print for a century or more, used not only by Anglicans but by readers of a variety of denominational allegiances.

# The Early Years

[Ryle](bio.jcryle) was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, into an upper-middle-class family on May 10, 1816.
After education at a local school, from 1828 to 1834 he attended the famous Eton College, across the river from Windsor Castle.
Here the nominal religion was that of the Church of England, the education was based upon the Greek and Latin classics, and the social context was that of the aristocracy and the rich.
Apart from gaining a thorough knowledge of classical languages, he also learned to get on with other people and not to expect to have his own way!
From Eton College, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) went on to Christ Church, Oxford, the college where [John Owen](bio.JohnOwen) had been the dean in the 1650s.
One of his tutors was [Henry Liddell](bio.henrygeorgeliddell), famous for his Greek lexicon.
In the years 1834–37
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) excelled at the game of cricket and in his studies.
He gained a first-class degree and could have stayed on at Oxford with a fellowship at one of the colleges, and become an academic.
However, thinking that he would follow his father in banking and business, he did not accept any Oxford appointment but returned home.
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) was at Oxford during the early years of the Oxford (Anglo-Catholic) Movement, but it did not attract him then or during later life.
In fact he was to become an opponent of the ceremonialism introduced by the clerical members of the movement.
Yet it was towards the close of his Oxford career that he began to think seriously about Christ and Christianity.
In his incomplete autobiography he wrote that “the circumstances which led to a complete change in my character were very many and very various… .
It was not a sudden change but very gradual.
I cannot trace it to one person, or any one event or thing, but to a singular variety of persons and things.
In all of them I believe now the [Holy Ghost](bk.#GodTheSpirit) was working though I did not know it at the time.”  
 Amongst the influences on [Ryle](bio.jcryle) were several evangelical clergy at Macclesfield, compulsory study of the Thirty-nine Articles (both at Eton and at Oxford), and the reading of A Practical View, the evangelical classic by [William Wilberforce](bio.WilliamWilberforce).
During this period when he felt himself being drawn into a committed (in contrast to a nominal) Christianity, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) developed very clear doctrinal views:
The leading things which seemed to flash out before my mind, as clearly and sharply as the picture of a photographic plate when the developing liquid is poured over it, were such as these.
The extreme sinfulness of sin, and my own personal sinfulness, helplessness, and spiritual need: the entire suitableness of the Lord [Jesus Christ](bk.#Jesus) by his sacrifice, substitution, and intercession to be the Savior of a sinner’s soul: the absolute necessity of anybody who would be saved being born again or converted by the [Holy Ghost](bk.#GodTheSpirit): the indispensable necessity of holiness of life, being the only evidence of a true Christian: the absolute need of coming out from the world and being separate from its vain customs, recreation, and standards of what is right, as well as from its sins: the supremacy of the Bible as the only rule of what is true in faith, or right in practice, and the need of regular study and reading of it: the absolute necessity of daily, private prayer and communion with [God](bk.#God) if anyone intends to live the life of a true Christian: the enormous values of what are called Protestant principles as compared to Romanism: the unspeakable excellence and beauty of the doctrine of the Second Advent of our Lord and Saviour, [Jesus Christ](bk.#Jesus):
[and] the unutterable folly of supposing that baptism is regeneration, or formal-going-to-church
[is] Christianity, or taking the sacrament [is] a means of wiping away sins, or clergymen to know more of the Bible than other people or to be mediators between [God](bk.#God) and men by virtue of their office.
Though he had been baptized as a baby and regularly attended the parish church and the college chapels, it was only when he reached the age of twenty-one that he was inwardly converted to [Jesus Christ](bk.#Jesus) and came to a very clear understanding of the faith.
He would later recall: “Nothing I can remember to this day appeared to me so clear and distinct, as my own sinfulness, [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s preciousness, the value of the Bible, the need of being born again, and the enormous folly of the whole doctrine of baptismal regeneration.
All these things . . . seemed to flash upon me like a sunbeam in the winter of 1837 and have stuck in my mind from that time down to this.”  
 Not surprisingly, [Ryle](bio.jcryle)’s conversion caused the loss of some friends and the gaining of new ones, who shared his evangelical faith.

## Tragedy

From 1837 to 1841 [Ryle](bio.jcryle) lived in London and at home in Cheshire, where he worked in his father’s bank.
His parents tolerated his evangelical faith but did not encourage him.
All seemed to be going well until the bank unexpectedly collapsed.
“In the month of June, 1841,” he wrote, “I had to pass through the greatest change in a temporal point of view that I ever went through in my life.”
Recounting the disaster in a different way, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) wrote: “We got up one summer’s morning with all the world before us as usual, and went to bed that same night completely and entirely ruined.”
The family lost the house, servants, and income!
Though his external reaction was exemplary, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) suffered much inwardly and for the rest of his life found it difficult to get over the great humiliation.
Reflecting upon this terrible experience from the perspective of his Christian faith he wrote: “I believe that [God](bk.#God) never expects us to feel no suffering or pain when it pleases him to visit us with affliction.
There are great mistakes upon this point.
Submission to [God](bk.#God)’s will is perfectly compatible with intense and keen suffering under the chastisement of his will.
Troubles not felt are in fact not troubles at all.
To feel trouble deeply and yet submit to it patiently is that which is required of a Christian.”  
 And he quoted [Richard Baxter](bio.RichardBaxter.1), who said, “I groan
but I do not grumble.”
On December 12, 1841, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) was ordained in the private chapel of the evangelical bishop of Winchester, [Charles Sumner](bio.charlessumner_1).
He became a clergyman not because of any special calling, but simply because to do so meant he had an income!
That is, he received enough to live in a humble way but not in the style to which he was accustomed.
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) served as an assistant curate in the parish of Fawley, in the New Forest, Hampshire, for two years.
With his usual commitment he gave himself wholeheartedly to the work and thus learned by experience the art of preaching and of visitation.
But illness forced him to take a break before he became rector in the parish of St. Thomas, Winchester, in December 1843.
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) had not been in Winchester long before he received from the lord chancellor the offer of the rectory of Helmingham in Suffolk.
The major attraction of Helmingham was that it paid a much better stipend than did Winchester.
Since [Ryle](bio.jcryle) wanted to be financially independent and in a position to marry, he accepted the offer.
Before he left the city he did, however, have some friendly and long conversations on the topic of baptismal regeneration with a leading High Churchman of the day, Bishop [Samuel Wilberforce](bio.SamuelWilberforce), who was then a canon of Winchester Cathedral.

## East Anglia

From 1844 to 1861 [Ryle](bio.jcryle) lived in Helmingham as rector of the parish.
He married [Matilda Charlotte Louisa Plumptre](bio.matildacharlottelouisaplumptre_1) on October 29, 1844; and their child, [Georgina Matilda](bio.georginamatildaryle_1), was born in April 1846.
She was named [Georgina](bio.georginamatildaryle_1) in memory of [Lady Georgina Tollemache](bio.ladygeorginatollemache_1) of Tollemache Hall in the parish, who had died a year earlier.
Regrettably, Mrs. [Ryle](bio.matildacharlottelouisaplumptre_1) took ill after the birth of her daughter and remained sick until her death in June 1847.
On February 21, 1850, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) married [Jessie Elizabeth Walker](bio.jessieelizabethwalker_1), who was [Georgina](bio.georginamatildaryle_1)’s godmother.
Their marriage lasted ten years before she died of [Bright](bio.richardbright_1)’s disease in 1860.
She gave birth to one daughter [(Jessie Isabell](bio.jessieisabellryle_1)) and three sons ([Reginald John](bio.reginaldjohnryle_1), [Herbert Edward](bio.herbertedwardryle), and [Arthur Johnston](bio.arthurjohnstonryle_1)).
In October 1861, soon after his move to Stradbroke (where he remained from 1861 until 1880), [Ryle](bio.jcryle) married [Henrietta Legh-Clowes](bio.henriettaleghclowes_1), who proved a fine mother to his five children.
As rector of Helmingham, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) developed a simple and effective way of both speaking and writing.
Increasingly he was called upon to speak at the meetings of evangelical societies in Suffolk and London.
Further, he began to write tracts which were published in Ipswich by [William Hunt](bio.williamhunt_1).
By 1859 [Hunt](bio.williamhunt_1) could offer seven volumes of tracts under the title of Home Truths.
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) had the writer’s gift of a judicious use of the imagination, and this is what made his evangelical writings so popular.
[Hunt](bio.williamhunt_1) also published two collections of hymns for [Ryle](bio.jcryle) in 1849 and 1860.
Apart from tracts and pamphlets, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) also did more sustained and serious writing in East Anglia biblical commentary, biographies of spiritual leaders, expositions of doctrine, and calls to sanctification.
After the move to Stradbroke in 1861, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) became more involved in the ecclesiastical and doctrinal issues of the day, and was in even greater demand as a speaker and preacher.
He was acutely aware of the progress of the Anglo-Catholic movement with its growing stress on ritualism and ceremonialism.
Not only did he preach and write against these innovations (see his booklet
What Do We Owe to the Reformation?), but he raised money to restore Stradbroke parish church so that his successors would have no excuse to introduce “ornaments or fittings of an un-Protestant character.”
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) was also greatly concerned about the lack of unity and common purpose amongst those in the Church of England who called themselves evangelicals.
He took part in various activities to bring about a working union.
But there were all kinds of forces pulling the movement apart.
One was a disagreement over the way to holiness.
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) followed the traditional Puritan and Calvinist approach, and thus could not appreciate what seemed to him the new and truncated forms of holiness taught by those influenced by [Robert Pearsall Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) and his book Holiness through Faith (1870).
In the eyes of his fellow evangelicals, [Ryle](bio.jcryle)’s most controversial activity was his attendance at the church congress, which met annually in different cities, and which evolved into the church assembly (now the general synod).
Here he boldly spoke for the Protestant principles of the national church.
Defending his attendance he wrote: “I do not particularly like Congresses.
I never expect them to do very much for the Church, or add much to our stock of knowledge.
I have attended them purely as a matter of duty.
I have advised others to attend them for the same reason.
But one good thing I am convinced they do.
They help churchmen to understand one another and in this way they are useful.”  
 On a personal level this exposure to the comprehensiveness of the church prepared [Ryle](bio.jcryle) for the call which came to him at the age of sixty-four to become the first bishop of the new diocese of Liverpool, a growing city and the nation’s busiest port.

## Liverpool

Oxford University recognized its first-class-honors graduate of 1837 by conferring on [Ryle](bio.jcryle) the degree of doctor of divinity in May 1880.
He was consecrated bishop in York Minster on June 11, 1880, and sat in his “cathedral” in Liverpool on July 1.
In “A Pastoral Letter” issued that day he asked for the prayers of his clergy and urged them to preach the Word and administer the sacraments with faithfulness.
And, bearing in mind that his new diocese had a variety not only of evangelical clergy, but also of High Church and Broad Church clergy as well, he wrote: “I ask you, in the last place, to assist me by cultivating and encouraging a spirit of brotherly love, charity and forbearance among Churchmen.
In a fallen world like ours, and in a free country like England, it is vain to expect all men to see things alike and to interpret the language of the formularies precisely in the same way.
Let us on no account be colourless Churchmen destitute of any distinct opinions.
But so long as any brother walks loyally within the limits of the Articles and the Prayer Book, let us respect him and treat him courteously, even when we do not altogether agree with him.”
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) was not only calling upon his clergy, but was making a resolution as to how he himself would behave.
It was not going to be easy, given the tensions caused by the growth of the Anglo-Catholic and ritualist movements.
Therefore one matter on which [Ryle](bio.jcryle) spent more time than he desired was his attempt to stop or to minimize the presence of ceremonialism and ritualism in the High Church parishes of the diocese.
Towards the end of his episcopate he issued a pastoral letter on “lawlessness” in public worship (1897).
Though only a few were being lawless, he was well aware of the spread of the ritualist movement in the national church.
So he requested his clergy to abstain from the use of incense, of lighted candles on the communion table, of priestly vestments, of catechisms which taught Mariolatry, of prayers for the departed, of the reserved sacrament (retention of a portion of the elements either for adoration in the church or for administration to the sick), of auricular confession, and of the word mass.
In a more positive key, the bishop made the recruitment and use of “more living agents,” ordained and lay, to be a priority.
In his first charge to the diocese he described the great but desperately needy city of Liverpool and then went on to say: “If the Established Church of this country claims to be ‘the Church of the people,’ it is her bounden duty to see that no part of the people are left like sheep without a shepherd.
If she claims to be a territorial and not a congregational church, she should never rest until there is neither a street, nor a lane, nor a house, nor a garret, nor a cellar, nor a family, which is not regularly looked after, and provided with the offer of means of grace by her officials.”
Accordingly, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) encouraged the building of mission halls and churches as well as the recruitment of caring and evangelical people for ministry.
Though he had little time to write material other than that required for his diocesan work, [Ryle](bio.jcryle) did raise contemporary theological issues in his charges.
In 1893 he spoke about the higher criticism of the Old Testament and publicly rejected the current Germanic theories on the origin of the Pentateuch and the Psalter.
This meant that he had taken a position very different from that of his brilliant son [Herbert](bio.herbertedwardryle), who as a professor at Cambridge had adopted and commended such theories both in his teaching and in his writings.
In fact, while staying with his father in Liverpool, [Herbert](bio.herbertedwardryle) once noted, “I write in a land where . . .
German criticism has not obtained much foothold, even in the bookshelves.”
However, father and son remained good friends, especially so after the death of Mrs. Ryle in 1889.
Of course as a bishop [Ryle](bio.jcryle) was obliged to take part in a host of meetings, but he sought to keep these to a minimum often because of his age and poor health.
Sometimes he missed important events such as the Lambeth Conference of 1888, which issued the so-called Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral as a basis for Christian reunion.
He refused to accept it because he believed that it was not true to the Reformed character of the Church of England.
In this refusal he was in a minority.
Old age and ill health caused [Ryle](bio.jcryle) to resign the bishopric in early 1900.
In his farewell to the diocese he said: “Almost the last words of the great apostle to the Gentiles are before the eyes of my mind today: ‘I have finished the course: the time of my departure is at hand.’
After filling unexpectedly the office of your bishop for nearly twenty years, I am about to resign a post which years and failing health at the age of eighty-three told me I was not longer able to fill with advantage to the diocese or to the Church of England.”
After describing the approaching separation as a great wrench to his soul, he continued:
Before I leave you I ask you to accept a few parting words from an old minister who has had more than fifty-eight years’ experience, and during that time has seen and heard many things.
It is written: “Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom” ( 32:7).
Let me, then, charge all the clergy whom I am about to leave behind me never to neglect their preaching.
Your districts and population may be comparatively small or large, but the minds of your people are thoroughly awake.
They will not be content with dull, tame sermons; they want life, and light, and fire and love in the pulpit, as well as in the parish.
Let them have plenty of it.
Never forget that a lively, Christ-exalting minister will always have a church-going people.”
Then in closing he urged all the people of [God](bk.#God) to “cling to the old Church of England … cling to its Bible, its Prayer Book and its Articles,” to “consider the many poor and needy,” and never to forget “that the principles of the Protestant Reformation made this country what she is, and let nothing ever tempt you to forsake them.”
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) died soon after his retirement.
Speaking at the memorial service, [Richard Hobson](bio.richardhobson_1) said: “A great man has just now fallen in Israel in the decease of the dear Bishop.
Yes, he was great through the abounding grace of [God](bk.#God).
He was great in stature; great in mental power; great in spirituality; great as a preacher and expositor of [God](bk.#God)’s most Holy Word; great in hospitality; great in winning souls to [God](bk.#God); great as a writer of Gospel tracts; great as an author of works which will live long; great as a Bishop of the Reformed Evangelical Church of England of which he was a noble defender; great as first Bishop of Liverpool.”  
 He was buried with his hand clasping his Bible in the same grave as that of his third wife.
On his gravestone were inscribed two texts: “For by grace are ye saved through faith” ( 2:8), and “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith” (2 **\_**4:7).

## Biblical Theologian

[Ryle](bio.jcryle)’s son [Herbert](bio.herbertedwardryle), as we have seen, became a Cambridge professor and a bishop of the Church of England.
Had [John Charles](bio.jcryle) stayed at Oxford in 1837 and taken up a fellowship, he too would have had an academic career.
But in the providence of [God](bk.#God), [John Charles](bio.jcryle) became a parish clergyman who used his brilliant mind and great energy both in pastoral work and in distilling the best of conservative theology and biblical interpretation for a hungry public.
Anyone who carefully looks over [Ryle](bio.jcryle)’s seven-volume Expository Thoughts on the Gospels, and who is familiar with commentaries and theological movements, will recognize that beneath the simple style there is great learning.
Since he was able to read Latin and Greek fluently, he made use of many commentaries in the classical languages.
Further, he consulted all the major conservative commentaries written in English.
However, he paid little attention to the works of the new higher critics because they told him little or nothing about the meaning of the sacred text.
It is instructive to read in the preface to the volumes on John the list of commentaries [Ryle](bio.jcryle) consulted and his views of them and their usefulness.
For example, he wrote: “The Fathers appear to me greatly overrated, as commentators and expositors.
[Cyril](bio.CyrilLucaris) and [Chrysostom](bio.JohnChrysostom.1) are far the most valuable of them, in my judgment, on [St. John](bk.#John).”  
 By the time he published the three volumes on John he very clearly held to plenary verbal inspiration.
Yet he did not also hold that all parts of the Bible are equally important.
That verses are equally inspired does not mean of necessity that they are equally important.
In interpretation [Ryle](bio.jcryle) followed the historical-grammatical exegesis of traditional Protestantism, allowing for typology but not the fourfold pattern of the medieval interpreters (the literal, moral, allegorical, and eschatological senses).
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) brought the fruit of his biblical study, together with his reading of the writings and the theology of the Protestant Reformers, the English and Scottish Puritans, and the evangelical leaders of the eighteenth century, to his expositions of the nature of the church, of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, of justification, of conversion, of faith, of practical doctrines, and of the pursuit of holiness.
This is seen very clearly in such books as Knots Untied, Old Paths, and Holiness, as well as in the hundreds of tracts and sermons he published.
He is still eminently readable today because of his simple style and his commitment to applying the plain grammatical sense of Scripture to the human heart.
A perusal of his writings reveals [Ryle](bio.jcryle)’s chief concerns and interests evangelism and sound teaching, biblical exposition, the pursuit of personal holiness, devotional material, Christian biography, together with controversial doctrinal and liturgical issues (e.g., ritualism) in the Church of England.
What we miss in his writings are expositions of the very basic dogmas of Christianity the holy, blessed, and undivided Trinity, and the person and nature of our Lord [Jesus Christ](bk.#Jesus), who is one person with two natures.
[Ryle](bio.jcryle) took these for granted, and perhaps that was a mistake.
This said, it may be claimed that there is no finer exposition of a moderate biblical Calvinism in accessible English than the writings of [John Charles Ryle](bio.jcryle).

# [William Henry Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)/ [Marion Ann Taylor](bio.mariontaylor)

A very learned Old Testament scholar at Princeton Theological Seminary, [William Henry Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) has long been remembered as the great naysayer against radical higher criticism and as a strong defender of traditional views about the authorship, integrity, and inspiration of the Old Testament.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was born on January 27, 1825, in Groveville, a small town near Princeton, New Jersey.  
Brought up in a family which had long-standing ties to the Presbyterian church, the academic institutions in Princeton, and the judiciary of the state of New Jersey, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was given a very fine education.
At the age of ten, he was sent to live with his maternal grandparents in Easton, Pennsylvania, so that he could attend a renowned classical school.
Two years later, he entered Lafayette College.
In 1840, at the age of fifteen, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) graduated with honors.
He then worked as a tutor in mathematics at Lafayette before beginning his first year of theological studies at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1842.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) interrupted his theological education to assume the position of adjunct professor of mathematics at Lafayette for the academic year 1843–44.
In 1846, upon the completion of two years of further study at the seminary, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) accepted a scholarship for a year of graduate study at the seminary and the offer of a teaching assistantship in Hebrew.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s appointment as an instructor in Hebrew at the age of twenty-one marked the beginning of his lifelong teaching career at Princeton Seminary.
During the second and third years of his appointment, he gained some practical experience by working as a supply minister for the First and Second Presbyterian Churches of Princeton.
In 1849, he accepted a call from the Central Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia, where he gained the reputation of being “a laborious, faithful and sympathetic pastor.”  
Then in 1851 the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church elected [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) to the chair of biblical and Oriental literature at Princeton Seminary, a position which he held until his death on February 10, 1900.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s education at Princeton Seminary under the tutelage of [Archibald Alexander](bio.ArchibaldAlexander), [Samuel Miller](bio.samuelmiller), and [Charles Hodge](bio.CharlesHodge) had a profound influence on him.
But it was the brilliant yet eccentric [Joseph Addison Alexander](bio.josephaddisonalexander) who became [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s personal mentor. [Alexander](bio.josephaddisonalexander)
[Alexander](bio.josephaddisonalexander), the son of the seminary’s founder [Archibald Alexander](bio.ArchibaldAlexander), had received his education at Princeton under the direction of his father and [Charles Hodge](bio.CharlesHodge).
He then studied in Europe, where he was especially drawn to the work of the critically informed yet orthodox German confessionalists [E. W. Hengstenberg](bio.ewhengstenberg) and [Friedrich A. G. Tholuck](bio.friedrichtholuck).
The training which [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) received from [Alexander](bio.josephaddisonalexander) in Hebrew, comparative Semitic languages and Old Testament history, literature, and interpretation was the finest available in the United States at that time.
Then in 1858 [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) traveled to Germany to study under [Alexander](bio.josephaddisonalexander)’s mentor [Hengstenberg](bio.ewhengstenberg).
[Alexander](bio.josephaddisonalexander)’s influence on [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) can be traced throughout his career, although as [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) matured and as the issues in the field of Old Testament studies changed, he developed his own areas of expertise and a distinctive role in both the church and the academy.
When [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was inaugurated as professor of biblical and Oriental literature in 1851, it was already recognized that a battle over the Scriptures was impending, a battle which would be fought on the grounds covered by [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s department.  
The charge given to [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) at his inauguration centered on his responsibilities for fighting the intellectual battles of the church and the seminary.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was directed to follow the model of Christian scholarship established by his predecessors.
He was to use the beneficial aspects of modern critical studies, to take a leadership role in the battle against such enemies as “traditionists” and “advocates of a mere nominal inspiration,” and to train his students to do the same. [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) faithfully carried out these directives in the classroom, in the pulpit, in public debates, and in the articles and books he wrote for academic and popular audiences throughout his life.
Among the most significant evidences of [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s contributions to biblical studies are his influence on his students (who numbered more than three thousand) and the many publications which developed out of his work in the classroom.
As a teacher of Hebrew and Oriental languages, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was very exacting yet understanding.
His students gained a thorough knowledge of the Hebrew language and were influenced by his passion for Old Testament texts, his confidence that linguistic studies would support the Princetonian confessional stance, and his commitment to discipline and hard work.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s particularly keen students also learned Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic, and Sanskrit.
At the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of his appointment as a teaching assistant at the seminary, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was lauded as “the Hebrew teacher of his generation … in fact, the most influential Hebrew teacher of his time among English-speaking men.”  
Students at Princeton and far beyond benefited from his two Hebrew grammars (1861, 1866) and his Hebrew Chrestomathy (1863).
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s work in Hebrew grammar, especially in the early sixties, represented a major contribution to the field of Hebrew studies in America.
The later revisions of his grammars did not have the same impact on the discipline.

## General Introduction to the Old Testament

[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s teaching responsibilities included courses in general introduction, which dealt with the canon and text of Scripture and hermeneutics.
Questions about the canon were of special interest to [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) throughout his career in view of the new and ever-changing critical issues that challenged the traditional understanding of the canon as an inspired and authoritative collection of books.
In 1898 [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) published his General Introduction to the Old Testament: The Canon, which treated the topic “not theologically, but historically.”  
Curiously, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) began the volume with a “History of Introduction to the Old Testament,” a brief sketch extracted from an unpublished lecture of [J. A. Alexander](bio.josephaddisonalexander) from 1843.
Although this decision suited [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s historical predilections, it set an extremely negative tone for the book. [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) followed the approach of what he referred to as the Christian or believing school of such scholars as [E. W. Hengstenberg](bio.ewhengstenberg), [C. F. Keil](bio.CarlFriedrichKeil), [Johann Kurtz](bio.johannheinrichkurtz), and [Karl Noesgen](bio.karlnoesgen_1).
He defended this position against the views of the extreme critical school of scholars like [Eduard Reuss](bio.eduardreuss_1), [Julius Wellhausen](bio.juliuswellhausen), and [Abraham Kuenen](bio.AbrahamKuenen), and of the more moderate critical school of scholars like [Friedrich Bleek](bio.friedrichbleek_1), [Johann Stähelin](bio.johannstahelin_1), [Hermann Strack](bio.HermannStrack), [Eduard König](bio.eduardkonig_1), [William Robertson Smith](bio.williamrobertsonsmith), and [S. R. Driver](bio.SamuelDriver).  
On the issue of the formation of the canon, for example, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) argued against the views of scholars like [Heinrich Ewald](bio.georgheinrichewald), [August Dillmann](bio.augustdillmann), and [Johann Eichhorn](bio.JohannEichhorn), who rejected the traditional consensus that the books in the Old Testament were written by inspired writers.  
Thus he declared: “It is not the religious profit derived from these books which led to their admission into the canon, but it is their being inspired of [God](bk.#God) to guide the faith and practice of the church in other words, their canonicity which makes them profitable to the religious life.”
Similarly, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) attempted to show fallacies in the various critical arguments for the late dating of such books as Chronicles, Nehemiah, and Daniel.
For example, in response to the growing support for a second-century dating of Daniel, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) agreed with [Franz Delitzsch](bio.FranzDelitzsch) that the principal argument mounted against the authenticity of the Book of Daniel centered on the issues of miracles and predictive prophecy.
Then he outlined and attempted to respond to [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver)’s arguments for a late dating based on literary, linguistic, and historical rather than dogmatic grounds.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) remained unconvinced by [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver).
He was also frustrated by [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver)’s mediating position which, while adopting the critical conclusions for a second-century dating, at the same time held the book to have inspired and revelatory character.  
For [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen), the options seemed much more clear-cut: one either embraced the critical methodology and its presuppositions wholeheartedly, or else one held on tenaciously to a traditional understanding of the biblical texts as the inspired and revealed Word of [God](bk.#God).
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s volume on the canon was lauded by many for its timely, clear, and learned defense of the traditional views on the canon of the Old Testament.  
Others deemed [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s work to be outmoded and inadequate. [Charles Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs)
[Charles Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs), however, labeled [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s position a highly dangerous “modern American theory of canonicity” which had neither “the stamp of antiquity upon it,” nor “ecclesiastical authority behind it,” and yet made “loud claims of orthodoxy itself.” [Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs)
[Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs) felt that [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s position “forced American Presbyterianism [into] a serious and unreasonable war against the higher criticism.” [Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs)
[Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs)’s insight that [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s book had significance far beyond academic questions regarding the canon was undoubtedly true, since it also dealt with timely issues relating to the use of higher criticism in the church.
In 1899 [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) published a sequel, his General Introduction to the Old Testament: The Text.  
Like his book on the canon, the sequel presents a scholarly, conservative assessment of the subject matter.
The book evaluates both carefully and positively the character and condition of the text of the Old Testament.  
Specifically, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) sets forth the conservative approach which he had advocated as chairman of the American Bible Revision Committee: “The Masoretic text is on the whole vastly superior to [the Septuagint], and should not be corrected by it… .
In the great majority of cases where a divergence exists, the presumption is strongly in favor of the correctness of the Hebrew and against the Septuagint.” [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s preference for the Hebrew text was opposed by text critics who placed more confidence in the Septuagint text.
Thus [Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs) charged [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) and his school as representing “the same spirit of hostility” toward textual criticism that [Keil](bio.CarlFriedrichKeil) had shown in Germany.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) also addresses various critical issues relating to the text.
His approach and position become evident through his engagement with the critics.
For example, against those who, on the assumption that the Hebrew language changed over the course of eight centuries, argue that the Pentateuch was late, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) contends that all Semitic languages had a fixed and stationary quality, that the Israelites were isolated and relatively stable during this period, that their language was fixed through the influence of the books of [Moses](bk.#Moses), and that there are not enough data to trace the developments in Hebrew from the time of [Moses](bk.#Moses).  
More specifically, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) admits that “at first glance” the attempt of [Friedrich Giesebrecht](bio.friedrichgiesebrecht_1) and others to show the lateness of the language of the supposed priestly source (P) of the Pentateuch seems plausible and logical; there are, however, serious flaws in the methodology and argumentation. [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s engagement with the critics demonstrates his genuine interest in new proposals, his penchant for history and questions relating to the history of the Hebrew language, and his tendency to attack specific problems by using general arguments against the presuppositions or methodology of historical criticism.

## Special Introduction to the Old Testament

[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s courses in special introduction examined the authorship, integrity, and structure of the individual Old Testament books as well as questions relating to hermeneutics.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s extant lectures on individual books are most significant in that they show his commitment to a supernaturalist approach to the Old Testament texts, his remarkable sensitivity to the literary shape and organic structure of the books, his historical predilections, and his constant engagement with new critical ideas.
For example, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s lectures on Job (as well as his popular book on Job) show his awareness of the artistic features and literary shape of the book.  
Using a comprehensive hermeneutical or literary approach (as opposed to a fragmentary approach) to the Book of Job, he examined its plan and structure and considered it in its fuller canonical context.  
Although [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s work on Job was not polemical, he realized that a comprehensive approach which presupposes the unity of a book is an effective tool for staying the hand of the critic.
As the battle over the Scriptures intensified, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) made more use of the comprehensive approach as a defensive tool.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s lectures and unpublished notes on individual Old Testament books also reveal his human side as he honestly grapples with the methods and results of modern critical and historical studies.
An example of a personal struggle with the evidence that forced him to change his position on authorship and dating is found in an 1884 lecture on Ecclesiastes.
Following a systematic refutation of the various arguments that had been mounted against the traditional view of Solomonic authorship, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) briefly addresses the issue of language and style: “It is alleged, and the fact seems to be, that the Hebrew of this book is so Aramean that it must belong to a period later than [Solomon](bk.#Solomon); and the style is unlike that of any other of the writings of [Solomon](bk.#Solomon).” [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) does not go into details, but refers his students to the writings of [Delitzsch](bio.FranzDelitzsch), [Hengstenberg](bio.ewhengstenberg), and [Keil](bio.CarlFriedrichKeil), who flesh out the arguments against Solomonic authorship that are based on language and style.
He then suggests a possible answer to the problem of the presence of Aramean words and the diversity of style, but concludes the lecture with the honest admission that he cannot see how the argument from language can adequately be met: “We conclude, therefore, that it is decisive.
We agree with [Delitzsch](bio.FranzDelitzsch) that if the book is [Solomon](bk.#Solomon)’s we must give up everything like a history of the Hebrew language.
This is the uniform opinion of scholars at the present time.”  
A student’s candid notation that “[Dr. Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) does not see how to answer objections from style against this being by [Solomon](bk.#Solomon)” and [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s use of words like “puzzling” and “exceedingly perplexing” to describe the Book of Ecclesiastes suggest that [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s shift from his earlier traditional position regarding Solomonic authorship was difficult.  
However, in spite of the shift, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) still seems to tie the interpretation of the book to the person and life of [Solomon](bk.#Solomon).
In later discussion of the dating of the Book of Ecclesiastes, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) strongly implies that [Solomon](bk.#Solomon) did not write the book.
Against [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver)’s late-third- or early-second-century dating, he argues that the book may have been composed in the century after the Babylonian exile. [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s dating accords both with the position of the early Jewish historian [Josephus](bio.FlaviusJosephus), who associated the closing of the canon with the end of [Artaxerxes Longimanus](bio.artaxerxesi_1)’s reign, and with the traditional Jewish consensus that after the last prophet, [Malachi](bk.#Malachi.1), the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) departed from Israel. [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s willingness to change his position on the issue of the authorship of Ecclesiastes shows that there were times when his intellectual attraction to the scholarly consensus overruled his deep sense of loyalty to tradition and his general conservatism, although this was not generally the case.

## The Pentateuch and Higher Criticism

[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s publications and lecture notes indicate a very early interest in battling over fundamental issues like the integrity and Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.  
His first serious defense of the Pentateuch was The Pentateuch Vindicated from the Aspersions of [Bishop Colenso](bio.JohnColenso) (1863).
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s analysis and critique of each of [Colenso](bio.JohnColenso)’s aspersions against the integrity of the Old Testament were logical, commonsensical, and filled with sarcasm.
His apologetic defense of the Pentateuch was effective.
During the sixties and seventies, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) kept abreast of the latest developments in Continental scholarship and continued to publish reviews of important books.
However, it was not until the last decade of the nineteenth century, when the controversies over higher criticism intensified dramatically and moved to the American shores, that [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) took up a frontline position in the battle over the higher criticism and emerged as “the [Nestor](bio.Nestorius) of the conservative Old Testament School,” an “[Athanasius](bio.AthanasiusAlexandria) against the world.”
During this period of heightened warfare, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) recruited and trained students to defend the integrity of the Old Testament against its many critics.
In the church, he battled over the issue of the appropriateness of the use of higher criticism.
His engagements with [Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs), whom [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) increasingly viewed as an enemy within the ranks, peaked with the infamous [Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs) case, which did much to heighten awareness of historical criticism and the battle over the Pentateuch.  
Moreover, in both academic and popular presses, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) continuously and extensively battled with the proponents of radical and moderate higher criticism, whom he viewed as enemies of the traditional understanding of the Scriptures.
These people included, most notably, [Robertson Smith](bio.williamrobertsonsmith), [Kuenen](bio.AbrahamKuenen), [Wellhausen](bio.juliuswellhausen), [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver), [Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs), and [William Rainey Harper](bio.WilliamHarper).
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s 1895 publication, The Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch, was his final attempt to defend what he felt was the unanimous testimony of inspired and uninspired tradition regarding the unity and Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.
The book was not a new work, but a compilation of addresses and essays that over a thirty-year period had attempted to prove the traditional understanding and to disprove all other views.
Chapter 1 is a slightly abridged form of an article published originally in 1865 under the title “The Structure of the Old Testament.”  
Similarly, chapter 2, “The Plan and Contents of the Pentateuch,” is an adaptation of a lecture written in 1866 for his course in special introduction.
As early as 1866, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) had taught that the theme of the Pentateuch is “the establishing of Israel as the people of God.”  
In the battle in 1895 he used this unifying theme in combination with evidence of a unifying plan to argue for the unity of the composition of the Pentateuch as a whole.
This overarching unity, he writes, “creates a presumption that these books are, as they have been traditionally believed to be, the product of a single writer; and the presumption thus afforded must stand unless satisfactory proof can be brought to the contrary.”
In the third chapter [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) begins his full defense of Mosaic authorship with a discussion about the nature of the Pentateuch.  
In view of its importance as a historical record, the contents of which stand “in intimate relation to the problems of physical and ethnological science, to history and archaeology and religious faith,” the critical question is whether or not the Pentateuch is “a veritable, trustworthy record.” [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) ties this question into the issue of Mosaic authorship.
Although the credibility of the Pentateuch is “not absolutely dependent upon its Mosaic authorship,” for all intents and purposes it is, since a better case can be made for verity if the authorship of the Pentateuch is Mosaic: “If it was written by [Moses](bk.#Moses), then the history of the Mosaic age was recorded by a contemporary and eyewitness … and it must be confessed that there is in this fact the highest possible guaranty of the accuracy and truthfulness of the whole.”  
In his defense of Mosaic authorship, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) cites the following evidence: (1) support from tradition and the New Testament (those who accept [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) “as an infallible teacher” will, like him, assume Mosaic authorship); (2) “the firm faith of Israel” as attested to in the Old Testament; (3) the testimony in the pentateuchal legislation (and by extension of the narrative) that it was written by [Moses](bk.#Moses); (4) the style, language, and nature of the laws themselves; (5) direct and indirect allusions in the rest of the Old Testament; (6) the recognition of the Pentateuch’s authority by the northern kingdom; (7) the elementary character of the Pentateuch’s teachings; and (8) the Pentateuch’s familiarity with Egyptian words and customs.
Although the internal evidence alone convinced [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) that [Moses](bk.#Moses) wrote the Pentateuch, he also recognized the serious need to counter the criticisms that had been leveled against this position.
Thus he presented a comprehensive analysis and refutation of a variety of these criticisms: (1) the presence of anachronisms, inconsistencies, and incongruities in the text; (2) evidence of composite origin; (3) evidence of distinction and development in the law codes; and (4) evidence for the late dating of laws.  
In his discussion of the earliest objections to the tradition of Mosaic authorship, which were based on anachronisms, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) made one of his few concessions to his critics: “It is far easier to assume that some slight additions may here and there have been made to the text, than to set aside the multiplied and invincible proofs that the Pentateuch was the production of [Moses](bk.#Moses).”
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s treatment of the more difficult issue of evidence of a composite authorship was quite detailed.
He countered the critics point by point with arguments that he had rehearsed many times before.
In dealing with this issue his primary interest was not the prehistory of the text.
For him the critical matter was the choice between Mosaic authorship, “whatever may have been the sources from which the materials were taken,” and composite authorship.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s treatment of the classic evidence for composite authorship (i.e., the alternation of divine names, parallel passages, and diversity in diction, style, and ideas) focused on the critical method itself rather than on the interpretation of data.
For example, he parodied the critical method by applying to stories such as the prodigal son and the good Samaritan a critical analysis along the lines of [Charles Mead](bio.charlesmmead)’s dissection of the Book of Romans into four sources on the basis of differences in diction, style, and doctrine.  
On the basis of the evident absurdity of these illustrations, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) concluded that “no dependence can be placed upon a process that leads to palpably erroneous conclusions in other cases.
An argument that will prove everything, proves nothing.”
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) included a separate chapter on the developmental hypothesis regarding Israelite law.
Again his critique focused on the assumptions and arguments that were used to support the critical position.
Basic to [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s aversion to the developmental hypothesis was his belief that it not only goes against “explicit statements of the Pentateuch itself, but is utterly inconsistent with the history on which it is professedly based.” [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) concluded that there is “no good reason” for abandoning the biblical statements regarding the Mosaic authorship of the law.
As we noted earlier, in The Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) added little to the painstaking efforts he had already made in defense of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch and in opposition to higher-critical reconstructions.
And yet one senses that for [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) the book represented a crystalization of his position in the 1890s.
In the final chapter, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) gets to the heart of his personal polemic against higher criticism.
First, he claims that the pernicious critical theories contain a bias against the supernatural which manifests itself in the rejection of “the reality of miracles and prophecy and immediate divine revelation in their genuine and evangelical sense.”  
Second, since biblical religion is necessarily a historical religion based on palpable facts, the documentary hypothesis is untenable.  
Third, he points out that modern pentateuchal criticism undermines the theological unity of the Testaments.
Fourth, he argues against the more moderate critics like [Delitzsch](bio.FranzDelitzsch), [Robertson Smith](bio.williamrobertsonsmith), and [Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs) that there is no middle ground on the issue of Mosaic authorship.
Mosaic authorship and historical veracity and by extension, inspiration and all of the other doctrines of faith were inextricably linked for [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen).
His final word to those who professed faith and higher criticism was an invitation to “revise their own ill-judged alliance with the enemies of evangelical truth” and reconsider whether “[Christ](bk.#Christ)’s view of the Old Testament may not, after all, be the true view.”
In 1895 [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) published The Unity of the Book of Genesis, in which he argues similarly that the literary unity of the book attests to unity of authorship.
While much of [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s volume consists of a rehearsal and critique of the critics’ diachronic approach to consecutive sections of Genesis, his arguments for the unity of the book based on his sensitive observations about its present shape and meaning are significant, for they adumbrate an approach to the study of Genesis which has only recently been discovered by postcritical Old Testament scholars.
Concerning the literary function of the formula (“these are the generations of”) in 2:4 , [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) cogently observes that, functioning as a heading for the section which follows, “it plainly declares the subject of [that] section to be not the creation of the world, but the formation of man and the first stage of human history.” [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) argues further that 2 is not to be regarded as a parallel account of creation that came about through the arbitrary juxtaposition of the J (Yahwist source) account of creation and the P (priestly source) account in chapter 1, but rather as a supplement and “natural sequence … the next act, so to speak, in the divine drama … of the unfolding plan of [God](bk.#God).”  
In this way [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) uses his comprehensive hermeneutical approach to defend the unity of the book and Mosaic authorship.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s Unity of the Book of Genesis together with his classic Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch constitutes his ultimate defense of the unity and Mosaic authorship of Genesis and of the Pentateuch.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s defense, particularly his arguments against the documentary hypothesis and the presuppositions undergirding the entire critical enterprise, has never been superseded in the eyes of those who continue to share many of his theological presuppositions and to promote his negative assessment of classic higher criticism.
Indeed many of his spiritual heirs have either simply used [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s works or updated and reformulated his views.  
Unfortunately, because [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s genuine insights into the literary shape of the text were tied inextricably into his highly polemical apologetic regarding the historicity and Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, they were lost to many of his generation.
Those who rejected his conclusion that literary intentionality can be explained only through single authorship and historicity also ignored his insights into the literary nature of the texts.
On the other hand, those who were attracted to his apologetic defense were primarily interested in his conclusions, not his mode of argumentation.

## The Reaction to [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s Publications

Responses to [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s 1895 publications were mixed.
One reviewer of The Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch described [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) as a warrior: “The Pentateuch and nothing but the Pentateuch that is [Dr. Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s battle-flag.”  
Another spoke of his book as a work of “the chief of staff of the army of American Hebraists and Old Testament students … a survey of the whole field of battle, of the points of attack and defense,” and a guide to “the only roads by which the victory is won.”  
To “all those in America who believe the Bible to be [God](bk.#God)’s Word,” the same reviewer commended [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) as “a champion, a leader, whose reverent spirit towards [God](bk.#God) and His Word, whose learning and knowledge and strong common sense, whose fairness to opponents and clear perception of the impregnable rock, abundantly qualify him for that position.” [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s work as an apologist was appreciated by many in the church who felt confused and somewhat overwhelmed by the information that they had about higher criticism.
Many in the church looked to [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) for answers.
However, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was certainly not without critics.
The caustic interchange in the Expository Times between a German reviewer, [Carl Steuernagel](bio.carlsteuernagel_1), and [Dunlop Moore](bio.dunlopmoore), a supporter of [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen), is quite revealing. [Steuernagel](bio.carlsteuernagel_1)
[Steuernagel](bio.carlsteuernagel_1) wrote disparagingly that “there is now but one Old Testament scholar who rejects the results of criticism.”  
He also charged [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) with superficiality, gross misrepresentation of the critical position and of the motives of critics, failure to recognize the human factor in the development of Scripture, lest the possibility of human error be introduced, and poor scholarship.  
Both [Steuernagel](bio.carlsteuernagel_1) and [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) recognized that their differences pointed to a serious impasse in terms of scholarly method.
[Steuernagel](bio.carlsteuernagel_1)’s expression of it was quite accurate: “On this point, moreover [namely, that [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) used specious reasoning to explain the alternations in the divine names in the Pentateuch], the possibility of coming to an understanding is quite excluded.
One who rejects criticism as a very principle will find a way satisfactory to himself over every difficulty; one, on the other hand, who in principle accepts the critical position, needs no guidance from me in order to discover the inadequacy of [Moore](bio.dunlopmoore)’s explanations.”  
If [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) had responded to [Steuernagel](bio.carlsteuernagel_1), he would probably have defended the hermeneutical method of harmonization, which he felt was in accord with the principles of common sense.
Addressing this very issue in 1895, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) had stated:
There is nothing for which the critics seem to have such an aversion as a harmonizing interpretation; and very naturally, for it annuls all their work.
And yet it is the plain dictate of common sense that the different parts of the same instrument should be interpreted in harmony, provided the language employed will in fairness admit of such an interpretation.
The simple observation of this obvious rule, together with the principle … that things which are really distinct should be treated as distinct, will not only relieve all the critical doubts and perplexities relative to the chapters now before us, but the great majority of those which are raised in the rest of Genesis and of the Pentateuch as well.
The gulf that separated [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) from the growing majority of Old Testament scholars was indeed real.
Moreover, [Steuernagel](bio.carlsteuernagel_1)’s characterization of [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) as a lonely naysayer to higher criticism would become more accurate over time.
Indeed, even as the century drew to a close, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) sensed that he was losing the battle that he had been fighting for so long.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) stood for a type of scholarship which had become increasingly outmoded in America in the nineteenth century.
Against those who advocated studying the Old Testament with a scientific and objective approach like that used for other literature, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) believed that such objectivity was impossible.
Hence he defended a distinctively Christian or supernaturalist approach which used the tools of modern scholarship to the extent that they did not clash with one’s precommitments to the Scriptures as the revealed and inspired Word of [God](bk.#God).
In coming to a study of the Scriptures a believing critic would presuppose their inspiration, integrity, and genuineness, and trust in revered traditions about their authorship, canonical ordering, and in some cases their interpretation.
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen)’s vision called for “a race of critics … of equal learning, ingenuity, and patient toil, who shall have some reverence for what is sacred, some respect for historical testimony, and some regard for the dictates of common sense.”  
While his particular approach was rejected by many, most contemporaries still felt themselves “under lasting obligation to [Dr. Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) for presenting the most scholarly arguments which support the traditional views.”
More positively, the postcritical phase of twentieth-century Old Testament scholarship with its emphasis on such issues as canon, text, authority, and the Bible as literature and Scripture, has in many ways vindicated the scholarship of [William Henry Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen).
For besides his work as an apologist, [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) correctly focused his scholarly energies on issues which have proven to be of fundamental importance to the study of the Old Testament.
Moreover, he correctly identified fundamental weaknesses in the critical approach.
However, because of the conservative theological stance of the Old Princeton School with which [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was associated, his genuine insights were lost to many of his contemporaries and of the next generation of Old Testament scholars.
Old Testament scholarship has only recently begun to shift its focus to the issues which [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) realized were of fundamental importance.

# [John Albert Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)/[David S. Dockery](bio.davidsdockery)

[John Albert Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was born on January 24, 1827, in Culpeper County, Virginia.
When he died on March 16, 1895, he was regarded as one of North America’s most capable biblical scholars and certainly one of the world’s greatest preachers.
Almost three decades after [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s death, his prize student, [A. T. Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson), reflected:
The world has never seemed the same to me since [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) passed on.
For ten years I was enthralled by the witchery of his matchless personality.
For three years I was his student.
For seven years I was his assistant and colleague and for part of the last year an inmate of his home.
It was my sacred and sad privilege to see the passing of this prince in Israel.
No man has ever stirred my nature as [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) did in the classroom and in the pulpit.
It has been my fortune to hear [Beecher](bio.HenryBeecher) and [Phillips Brooks](bio.PhillipsBrooks), [Maclaren](bio.AlexanderMaclaren), [Joseph Parker](bio.JosephParker) and [Spurgeon](bio.CharlesSpurgeon), [John Hall](bio.johnhall_1) and [Moody](bio.DwightMoody), [John Clifford](bio.JohnClifford) and [David Lloyd George](bio.davidlloydgeorge_1).
At his best and in a congenial atmosphere [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was the equal of any man that I have ever heard.
It comes as little surprise, then, that [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s first major publication was a tribute to the mentor whom he so greatly loved.
The Life and Letters of [John Albert Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was first published in 1901.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s esteem was reflected both in the length of the original manuscript over one thousand pages!
and its content.
Typical was [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s characterization of his friend and mentor as “one of the finest fruits of modern Christianity.”

## Life and Influence

### The Early Years

The Broadus family was of Welsh extraction (the name was originally Broadhurst) and had long been rooted in the soil of the Old Dominion.
They were a farming family, but several of [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s ancestors had devoted themselves to teaching, and others had become ministers of the gospel, some of them having attained great distinction and influence.
Most members of this deeply spiritual family belonged to the country Baptist churches of Virginia.
[John](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s father, Major [Edmund Broadus](bio.edmundbroadus_1), was a man of high character, ability, and independence of judgment that expressed itself in a variety of ways.
Not only was he a farmer and major in the Culpeper County militia, but he was also a miller, a teacher, a leader in the Whig Party, and a member of the Virginia legislature for eighteen years.
He was gifted with strong common sense and keen insight into the character and motives of people.
Above all he was a deeply spiritual man, an ardent Baptist, and a strong leader in his church and local association.
His life and work demonstrated that it was indeed possible for a public figure of his day to be an active Christian.
The extraordinary accomplishments of [John Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) can in many ways be traced to the marvelous model, love, and wisdom exhibited by his father.
That a variety of social, political, and religious leaders frequented the [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) home was also of great influence.
In addition, Major [Broadus](bio.edmundbroadus_1) had offered much support to [Thomas Jefferson](bio.ThomasJefferson) in the development of the University of Virginia, with which his famous son was to be intimately associated.
And [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s mother was likewise a woman of godly character and a competence that admirably suited her to be the wife of her notable husband and the mother of her remarkable children.
[John Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was educated in the private subscription schools of Culpeper County.
His preparatory schooling was completed at the Black Hill Boarding School under the capable tutelage of his uncle, [Albert G. Simms](bio.albertgsimms_1).
Here young [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was well prepared for his years at the University of Virginia.
While still at his uncle’s school, [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus) attended a lengthy revival meeting conducted at the Mt. Poney Church by [Charles Lewis](bio.charleslewis_1) and [Barnett Grimsley](bio.barnettgrimsley_1).
Sensing [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s inability to take hold of the promises of [God](bk.#God), his close friend [James G. Field](bio.jamesgfield_1) quoted to him 6:37: “All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.”
[Field](bio.jamesgfield_1) pleaded, “Can you take hold of this, [John](bk.#John)?”
Somehow the [Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) used this passage, and young [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) experienced the gift of regeneration at that moment.
[Field](bio.jamesgfield_1) later recalled:
I knew him quite intimately from 1842 to 1847.
We were youths of about the same age, he going to school to his uncle, [Albert G. Simms](bio.albertgsimms_1), and I living in the store of Thomas Hill & Son, at Culpeper.
Our fathers had been opposing candidates for the legislature.
In May, 1843, at a protracted meeting conducted by Elder [Charles Lewis](bio.charleslewis_1) with the Mt. Poney Church, at Culpeper, we both professed conversion … and were baptized by Rev. [Cumberland George](bio.cumberlandgeorge_1)… .
[[John](bio.johnalbertbroadus)] did not remain in the Mt. Poney Church very long, but took his letter and joined New Salem, the church where his father and family had their membership.

### The University of Virginia Years

Following the advice of his teachers and pastors, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) began the study of Greek when he entered the University of Virginia in 1846.
This eager and dedicated student was endowed with great and rich gifts of mind as well as heart, which he never allowed to substitute for intense and persistent study.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was a toiler, the apostle of hard work throughout life, which he had learned in the farm country of Virginia.
It was later said of [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) that if genius is the ability and willingness to do hard work, he was a genius.
This diligent work ethic characterized him all his days.
Professor [F. H. Smith](bio.francishsmith_1) of the University of Virginia observed that while a student at the university [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) “cultivated a great power of application and grew to have a great ability to work, and was not ashamed that others should know it… .
The wonderful result of this steady, methodical industry was that in later years he could do unheard-of things in the briefest time.
His disciplined faculties were so under his will that the result, while natural, was surprising.”
While at the University of Virginia [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) continued to mature in his Christian faith.
Considering his conversion a call to service, he sought throughout the rest of his life to bring others to Christian belief.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) tells of the first evangelistic effort, an experience that [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) frequently shared with his students in later days: “In a meeting a few months after [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s conversion, the preacher urged all Christians at the close of the service to move about and talk to the unconverted.
[John](bio.johnalbertbroadus) looked anxiously around to see if there was anybody present he could talk to about his soul’s salvation.
He had never done anything of the kind before.
Finally he saw a man … named [Sandy](bio.sandy_1).
He thought he might venture to speak to him … and [Sandy](bio.sandy_1) was converted.”  
Thereafter, whenever [Sandy](bio.sandy_1) happened to see [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus), he would run up to him and say: “Howdy, [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus)! thankee, [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus).
Howdy, [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus)! thankee, [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus).”
As [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) retold the story in later years, he would add: “And if I ever reach the heavenly home and walk the golden streets, I know the first person to meet me will be [Sandy](bio.sandy_1), coming and saying again: ‘Howdy, [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus)! thankee, [John](bio.johnalbertbroadus).’ ”
Another event typical of the university years warrants mention.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) once wrote a note in Greek to a fellow student: “
(one thing thou lackest).”
This simultaneous compliment and delicate admonition eventually bore fruit in his friend’s conversion.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) frequently utilized his everyday contacts and relationships to communicate the truths of the gospel.
These events and others like them confirmed [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s call to ministry.
It was not unexpected that he should consider ministry as a possible lifework.
An uncle who was a notable preacher took special interest in his gifted nephew.
Several other members of the [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) family had been ministers.
[John](bio.johnalbertbroadus) began to manifest serious interest in Christian service at the time of his conversion.
He regularly attended church services on Sunday as well as Wednesday and Saturday.
His work in Sunday school convinced him that he was called to preach.
Yet he struggled with the call because he could not speak well in public.
But in 1846, the year he entered the university, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) surrendered to the ministry; never again for one moment did he waver.
The years at the University of Virginia had a profound effect.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was particularly influenced by two professors: [Gessner Harrison](bio.gessnerharrison_1), professor of Greek; and [W. H. McGuffey](bio.whmcguffey_1), professor of moral philosophy.
Though he initially struggled with the high demands of the University of Virginia curriculum, he was regarded as a promising scholar by the time he graduated with the A.M. degree in 1850.
Following graduation he set for himself a broad self-study course in the Old and New Testaments, church history, and theology.
On August 12 of that same year he was ordained at the New Salem Church, which he had joined soon after his conversion.
If all of this were not enough for one year, he also (in 1850) married the daughter of [Gessner Harrison](bio.gessnerharrison_1), his esteemed professor and friend.
Numerous opportunities for teaching and preaching soon came to [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus), and would follow him the rest of his life.
Yet he held few positions during his lifetime.
His only pastorate began in September 1851 at Charlottesville, Virginia, which enabled him simultaneously to accept the invitation from his alma mater to serve as an assistant professor of Latin and Greek.
Thus he was able at once to combine his dual loves of preaching and teaching.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) served the church for eight years.
From 1855 to 1857 he also served as the university chaplain.

### The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Years

[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) never attended a seminary.
His university education provided an outstanding background in the classical languages and philosophy, but his theological preparation, like so many other Baptist preachers in the South, came about through self-study.
The freestanding theological seminary was a distinctively American idea, and was by this time becoming recognized in the American educational system.
Newton Theological Institute had been in operation in the North since 1825, but there was no Baptist seminary in the South.
The vision for such a seminary came largely through [James Petigru Boyce](bio.jamespetigruboyce).
While [Boyce](bio.jamespetigruboyce) is generally credited with the founding of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, he could not have built the institution without [Basil Manly, Jr.](bio.basilmanlyjr), and especially [John A. Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus).  
In 1856 [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was appointed by the Southern Baptist Convention to serve on a study committee to prepare a plan for the new seminary.
This introduced [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) to what was to be his life’s work.
When [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) and [Manly](bio.basilmanlyjr) were asked to join the original seminary faculty, both responded to one another, “I’ll go if you will go.”
Still [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) wrestled with leaving the Charlottesville pastorate and his beloved Virginia homeland.
When the time came for him to respond to the invitation from the seminary, it took a year for him to decide to tear himself away from his first love; when he did agree to go to the new seminary in Greenville, South Carolina, the decision brought great sorrow both to him and to the church.
Even though [Manly](bio.basilmanlyjr) and [Boyce](bio.jamespetigruboyce) had been educated in northern seminaries, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was given the assignment to organize the curriculum.
Not surprisingly, his proposal was based largely on a University of Virginia model: heavy emphasis was placed on study of the English Bible, and the students were given freedom in their selection of course work.
It was a creative proposal that was fifty years ahead of most theological education in North America.
While offering something for every student, the plan emphasized rigorous scholarship for the most able.
The seminary opened its doors in 1859 to twenty-six students.
Only three years later, however, the Civil War forced the new institution to suspend its course of study.
Apprised of the young professor’s gifts, Stonewall Jackson asked [J. William Jones](bio.jwilliamjones), an associate of [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus), to help secure his services as a chaplain: “Write to him by all means and beg him to come.
Tell him that he never had a better opportunity for preaching the gospel than he would have right now in these camps.”  
So, during the years of the Civil War, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) served as a preacher to the Army of Northern Virginia.
After the war the seminary reopened in the fall of 1865.
At this time [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) began his celebrated commentary on the Gospel of [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1).
He labored for twenty years on this project, which was ultimately published in 1886.
Another significant achievement received its impetus when the seminary recommenced classes after the Civil War.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) had only one student in his homiletics class, and this student was blind.
The lectures that [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) used to teach him were published in 1870.
For decades this volume, On the Preparation and Delivery of Sermons, was widely used throughout the world, and it is still employed today in some settings.
Without question it is [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s most famous work.  
The publication of the volume is clear evidence of [God](bk.#God)’s providential oversight.
Here is a book that came about through lectures to one blind student in a small, at that time almost anonymous, institution in Greenville, South Carolina.
In this influential volume [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus), who was already widely known as a preacher of rare ability and power, fleshes out the ideals of preaching that he had pursued over the past two decades.
These ideals had been shaped by his study of the great masters of the art of preaching throughout the history of the church.
When the seminary faced seemingly insurmountable financial obstacles in the mid-1870s, a decision was made to move the institution to Louisville, Kentucky, a more centrally located site.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus), too, moved to Louisville, his home until his death in 1895.
The move was successful largely because of [Boyce](bio.jamespetigruboyce)’s courageous vision, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s unrelenting will, and their common trust in [God](bk.#God).
Challenging his colleagues not to give up their efforts in behalf of the struggling seminary, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) uttered his famous words, “The seminary may die, but let us die first.”
Although [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was offered the pastorates of several prominent churches as well as the presidency of Brown University and Crozer Theological Seminary, all of which entailed significantly higher salaries, he chose to remain in his faculty position at the seminary.
Following [Boyce](bio.jamespetigruboyce)’s death, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was elected president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1889.
In the same year [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) delivered the prestigious [Lyman Beecher](bio.LymanBeecher) Lectures on preaching at Yale University.
Unfortunately, the lectures were never written down, and their contents can be reconstructed only from newspaper articles that appeared in the Examiner and the Christian Inquirer.  
([Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) never took notes into the pulpit and discouraged the transcribing of his messages.)
As his fame continued to spread, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was invited to deliver other prestigious lectures around the country, including a presentation on “Textual Criticism of the New Testament” at Newton and on “[Jesus of Nazareth](bk.#Jesus)” at Johns Hopkins University.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) had no greater impact than his influence on his prize student and son-in-law, [A. T. Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson).
A special bond formed between them, especially during [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s years on the Southern faculty.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) affectionately called [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) his “truest earthly friend.”
And [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) served as a model for the young professor in two disciplines for which [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) became equally, if not more, famous: New Testament interpretation and preaching.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) modeled for [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) an interpretive method that took into account the recent developments in critical scholarship but still remained true to the authority of Holy Scripture.
The critical textual notes [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) contributed to [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s Harmony of the Gospels reveal continuity with, and addition to, the [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) legacy.
One of the finest compliments [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) ever received was from [J. H. Farmer](bio.jhfarmer_1) of McMaster University: “Professor [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) has worthily maintained the [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) tradition.” [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s mammoth Grammar of the Greek New Testament and Word Pictures in the New Testament clearly reflect [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s impact.
The death of [Boyce](bio.jamespetigruboyce) and the added responsibility of presidential leadership had a considerable toll on [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus).
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) observed that after 1889 [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) never regained the buoyancy of life he had once had.
In his final year as president [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s health grew weaker.
Yet his standing as a national Baptist leader continued to build the seminary in terms of financial support as well as national and international recognition.
The great Baptist leader, preacher, and scholar died on March 16, 1895.
On that day the Louisville Courier-Journal reported, “There is no man in the United States whose passing would cause more widespread sorrow than that of Doctor [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus).”

## New Testament Scholar and Preacher

Many elements make up a person who is successful as both scholar and preacher.
Obviously he is blessed by divine enablement and multigiftedness.
On the human level such a person is a complex force.
The natural endowment must be there to begin with, and then there must be tireless energy and much preparation.
Many persons gifted as scholars or preachers are not successful.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) excelled because of his strong work ethic, the focus of his work, the subject matter explored, the drive for excellence, and his rigorous pursuit to handle the material accurately.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) authored tracts; articles for newspapers, popular magazines, and scholarly journals; major volumes; and an untold number of sermons.
As we have seen, his first major publication was On the Preparation and Delivery of Sermons (1870).
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was, of course, not the first to address the subject of preaching.
The incredible success of the book can be attributed to his marvelous ability to communicate complex material in a popular way.
He presented similar material in The History of Preaching, a more challenging and scholarly treatise based on five lectures given at Newton in 1876.
The volume that gained [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) a reputation as an evangelical biblical interpreter was his twenty-year effort on the Gospel of [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1).
While not as well known as On the Preparation and Delivery of Sermons, this volume in the American Commentary series is generally considered the greatest of all his works.
Just as significant volumes on preaching preceded [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s 1870 publication, so there were hundreds of works on the Gospel of [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1).
Yet for over a century [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s effort has clearly remained the most notable volume in the American Commentary series, and one of the truly scholarly volumes on the first Gospel.
Three other works on the Gospels are worthy of note.
Shortly after the publication of the [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) commentary, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) penned a brief work on [Jesus of Nazareth](bk.#Jesus), which was a revision of the lectures given at Johns Hopkins.
In 1893 he completed his Harmony of the Gospels, which [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) would revise several times over the years.
The Commentary on the Gospel of [Mark](bk.#Mark.1) was published posthumously in 1905.
Several other works on New Testament themes were never published.
When biblical authority and historical criticism became a major issue on the Southern campus, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) defended the full truthfulness of Scripture in Three Questions as to the Bible (1883) and The Paramount and Permanent Authority of the Bible (1887).
Finally, following the death of his beloved colaborer, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) authored The Memoir of [James Petrigru Boyce](bio.jamespetigruboyce) (1893).
With every publication [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) sought to edify his readers, to expand their knowledge, and to build up the church of [Jesus Christ](bk.#Jesus).
The conclusion to the preface of The History of Preaching could serve as the motto and prayer of all his writings: “[God](bk.#God) grant that the little volume may be of some real use!”
Each work reflects commitment to careful scholarship, industrious research, accuracy, and conscientiousness in communication.
Whatever [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) did was, in his favorite phrase, “worth working at.”
His works have retained their place over the years because they were not the effusions of mere ambition to be a published author.
Those who heard [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) said he was even a better preacher than writer.
Here he combined the scholarly commitment to New Testament exegesis so evident in his commentaries with a masterful understanding of the art of preaching.
The skillful yet simple touch of a craftsman was evident to all who heard him proclaim the message of [God](bk.#God)’s Word.

### Belief in Biblical Inspiration

To have an accurate understanding of [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s interpretive method and his distinctive contributions to interpretation in the evangelical tradition, we need to examine his view on the inspiration of the Bible.
Inspiration became a major issue on the campus of Southern Seminary in the 1870s and 1880s as the faculty attempted to respond to their colleague [C. H. Toy](bio.crawfordhowelltoy_1), who resigned over his acceptance of historical-critical conclusions.
The major treatise was produced by [Basil Manly, Jr.](bio.basilmanlyjr), and titled The Bible Doctrine of Inspiration (1888).
The key to understanding [Manly](bio.basilmanlyjr) and [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) is to recognize their common opposition to [Toy](bio.crawfordhowelltoy_1)’s doctrine of Scripture and its practical implications.  
While affirming plenary inspiration, [Manly](bio.basilmanlyjr) carefully refuted any theory of mechanical dictation.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) also refuted mechanical dictation, but was more cautious in his theorizing as to verbal inspiration.  
Both clearly affirmed every aspect of Scripture as infallible truth and divine authority.
In Three Questions as to the Bible, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s answer to the question “To what extent ought we regard the sacred writings of the Old and New Testaments as inspired?” was “Completely.”
But while unhesitatingly defending the trustworthiness and authority of the Bible, he was cautious in asserting a definition of inspiration.
Thus he wrote, “But whatever these [biblical] writers meant to say, or whatever we learn from subsequent revelation that [God](bk.#God) meant to say through their words, though not by themselves fully understood, that we hold to be true, thoroughly true, not only in substance but in statement… .
Even today I know of no discrepancies in the Bible which impair its credibility.”  
Similarly, his work The Paramount and Permanent Authority of the Bible took seriously the human authorship of the Bible as well as its divine origin.
He contended for the complete truthfulness of Holy Scripture in a manner reflective of other great Christian leaders of the nineteenth century like [Boyce](bio.jamespetigruboyce), [Manly](bio.basilmanlyjr), [J. L. Dagg](bio.johnldagg), and [Alvah Hovey](bio.alvahhovey), yet with an independence and creativity characteristic of all of his work.  
Perhaps most telling is [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s wish that the young seminarians in a New Testament class he addressed a few days before his death be “mighty in the scriptures.”
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) attributed the doctrinal unity among Baptists and other evangelicals during the nineteenth century to their emphasis on the authority of the Bible in matters of faith and practice.  
Accordingly, in The Paramount and Permanent Authority of the Bible he addressed himself “to people who believe that the Bible is the Word of [God](bk.#God); not merely that it contains the Word of [God](bk.#God), which wise persons may disentangle from other things in the book, but that it is the Word of [God](bk.#God)… .
It is entirely possible that we may have no creed or system of theology, no professors or even preachers, nor even newspaper writers, nor writers of tracts, that can always interpret the Bible with infallible success.
But our persuasion is that the real meaning of the Bible is true.”  
Here he explicitly affirms that the Bible, apart from human interpretation, has objective meaning and value.
While [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was at the forefront of American biblical scholarship in the nineteenth century and was a pacesetter in certain areas, he denied that all the progress of the nineteenth century made it “superior to all previous centuries in thinking, for in some respects our age has not time to be wiser.”  
Thus his careful and wise scholarship remained faithful to the authority of Holy Scripture as the only sufficient revelation of [God](bk.#God).
In his view “a ‘progressive orthodoxy’ that forsakes or adds to the teaching of [Christ](bk.#Jesus) becomes heterodoxy.” [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s words on the archeological, philosophical, and scientific debates of his time are equally applicable today.
“The great principle, in all such inquiries,” he declared, “is that while it is lawful to reinvestigate the Scripture in the light of current opinion and feeling, it is not lawful to put anything as authority above [God](bk.#God)’s Word.”  
This foundational commitment undergirded the painstaking and evenhanded exegesis that characterized his lifework.

### Method of Biblical Interpretation

[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s work, which reveals his broad exposure and up-to-date reading not only in his two major fields of New Testament and preaching, but in many other areas as well, has been concisely summarized by [William Mueller](bio.williammueller) as “honest, critical in the best sense, and reverent.”  
That he neither wholeheartedly accepted nor rejected the conclusions of nineteenth-century biblical criticism shows his general good sense as well as his understanding of the many pendulum swings throughout history.
To explain his interpretive method, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) offered five guiding steps in answer to the question, “How ought the inspired writings be treated by us?”

1. Ascertain the text.
   Convinced that a high view of inspiration should lead to great zeal for textual criticism, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) began with the work of textual criticism.
2. Procure the best possible translation.
   An accurate rendition of the original languages is indispensable.
   (Of course, translations can never fully bring out the exact meaning of the original text because they must seek a balance between accuracy and readability.)
3. Personally study the Bible.
   Simply reading a translation does not suffice as genuine biblical interpretation.
   Using historical and contextual helps, each Christian must make personal study of the Scriptures a priority.
4. Teach the Bible truth to others.
   [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s strong commitment to preaching led him to insist that Christians share with others the instruction they receive from Scripture.
5. Act out the Bible in everyday life.
   [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) urged his students and readers to put the Bible into practical service by displaying a missionary spirit.
   Moving from the critical apparatus to practical application, these steps link textual and historical methodologies with actually living out the message of the Bible.
   Here we see [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) as both scholar and preacher, academic and churchman.
   [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s commentaries put his method into practice.
   He began with a full commitment to historical-grammatical exegesis.
   His scholarly work was creative, but he was not infatuated with the novel.
   Accepted interpretations were set aside only when they seemed to be clearly wrong, and then only in a tender, respectful manner.
   He preferred accuracy to speculation.  
   In applying his exegesis, he provided helpful sermonic material for younger preachers.
   These applications were not overly simplistic, amorphously pietistic, nor fanciful in any way, but short, suggestive, and faithful to the text’s original meaning.
   In examining [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s Commentary on the Gospel of [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1), we note that the preface thoroughly discusses textual matters, including various viewpoints, comparisons, evaluations, and conclusions.
   For example, he states that “the general contributions to textual criticism made by [Westcott](bio.BrookeWestcott) and [Hort](bio.FentonHort) are invaluable, and most of their judgments as to particular passages seem to me correct.
   But in a number of cases I have felt bound to dissent, and to give the reasons as fully and strongly as the character and limits of this work allowed.”  
   The commentary itself, with its copious footnotes, proceeds to offer insights on Greek grammar and syntax.
   Yet the direct word-by-word, phrase-by-phrase exposition makes the work useful for the Sunday school teacher as well as for the scholar.
   [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) did not sidestep the tough questions impacting the veracity and accuracy of the biblical text.
   He addressed seeming contradictions and errors simply and directly, reflecting his conviction of and trust in the Bible’s truthfulness.  
   And after wrestling to determine the historical meaning of the text, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) completed his five-step approach with his “homiletical and practical” comments, wedding exacting exegesis with solid application.
   By focusing on the practical aspects as well, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) brilliantly combined his two specialties, showing that biblical interpretation must ultimately be done in the service of the church.
   We ought also note that the theological conclusions in the commentary on [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) evidence [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s Reformed convictions, the confessional traditions that gave birth to Southern Seminary.
   For example, he contended for the virgin birth (see the comments on 1:21), affirmed that [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) claimed to be the Messiah (see the comments on 13:10–17), and expounded the need for [God](bk.#God) to take the initiative to make himself known to depraved humans (see the comments on 22:14).
   Overall, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s work on [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) is a model commentary, and in many ways ushered in a new era of commentary writing within evangelical scholarship.  
   Significant advances included the incorporation of historical, textual, and grammatical research that was being done during his lifetime.
   He demonstrated an awareness of and conservative openness to European critical scholarship, but he was not willing to unreservedly subject Holy Scripture to the antisupernatural biases of many of the German critics.
   The inclusion of grammatical, exegetical, theological, and practical comments make the work valuable to a very wide readership.
   Commentaries are not the only place where [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) made original contributions.
   In the Harmony of the Gospels, as [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) notes, “Dr. [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was the first one to depart from the traditional division of the ministry of [Christ](bk.#Jesus) by the Passovers rather than the natural unfolding of the ministry itself… .
   Dr. [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s work is the ripe fruit of a lifetime of rich study and reflection by one of the rarest teachers of the New Testament that any age or country has ever seen.”  
   Here, too, [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s firm theological foundation and level-headed explorations allowed him to employ the best of European critical scholarship without embracing the conclusions.
   His openness has been misinterpreted by some.
   For example, [Roger Finke](bio.rogerfinke_1) and [Rodney Stark](bio.rodneystark_1) claim that “[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was extremely impressed with the application of critical methods to biblical studies that was going on in European universities, especially in Germany.”  
   On the other hand, [J. M. Carter](bio.jmcarter_1)’s notes on [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s lectures on New Testament introduction make it clear that while [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was certainly open to new advances, his interpretive method cannot be considered progressive.  
   He rejected recent critical notions that the Gospel of [John](bk.#John) is in conflict with the other Gospels.
   He clearly held to a Johannine authorship of the fourth Gospel.
   And he affirmed both the supernatural origin of the Gospels and their legitimacy as eyewitness accounts.
   At the same time [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) recognized the pitfalls in harmonizing the Gospels.
   It could fail to recognize and distinguish the unique emphases of each Gospel.
   He warned that the Gospels are not a mere mass to be artificially reconstructed, for each one is a living and independent whole.
   Yet he saw the values of harmonization as providing an overall look at the life of [Christ](bk.#Jesus) and a way to reconcile apparent discrepancies in the Gospels.
   Whether in his classroom lectures, in his scholarly treatises, or in his preaching, the striking feature of all of [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s work is the pervasive tone of solemn reverence and deep spirituality.
   His thoroughgoing scholarship and devotional spirit are a worthy model for all who have had the privilege of learning from him, whether as his contemporaries in the nineteenth century or as Bible students preparing for the twenty-first century.
   [John A. Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) practiced what he taught his students, for indeed he was a man “mighty in the Scriptures.”

# [Theodor Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)/[Erich H. Kiehl](bio.erichhkiehl_1)

[Theodor Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) was an eminent New Testament and patristic scholar of the nineteenth and the early decades of the twentieth century.
He was a careful and dedicated conservative theologian.
His extensive writings are characterized by great erudition and thoroughness.
A leader of conservative scholars in New Testament studies at a time when higher criticism was dominant, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s long and fruitful activity reflects the careful and dedicated training received during his childhood and youth from his gifted Christian parents.
Some detail on this is necessary to arrive at a well-informed understanding of his intellectual and theological stature.

## The Formative Years

[Theodor Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) was born on October 10, 1838, in Mörs, west of the Rhine between Düsseldorf and Wesel.
He was the eighth son of [Franz L. Zahn](bio.franzlzahn_1) and [Anna Zahn](bio.annazahn_1), née Schlatter.
Three brothers had died before his birth.
Two sisters were born after him.
[Theodor](bio.TheodorZahn)’s great-grandfather was [Johann Michael Zahn](bio.johannmichaelzahn_1), who served on the faculty at Wittenberg in philosophy.
After four years he turned to study theology, and at the age of thirty-four was assigned to a parish in his home territory.
Theodor’s grandfather, [Gottlieb Zahn](bio.gottliebzahn_1), was an outspoken rationalist who grieved that his children became dedicated Christians.
Two of his sons became pastors and a third served as a missionary to South Africa.
[Theodor](bio.TheodorZahn)’s father noted that in his childhood he experienced love only from his mother.
He did not receive any Christian training but only the rationalistic views of his father and teacher.
Later he studied law at the University of Jena, where through the influence of [G. H. Schubert](bio.ghschubert_1) he experienced the joy of the Christian faith.
After four years in legal practice and ongoing inner religious conflict, [Franz Zahn](bio.franzlzahn_1) began theological studies.
Then serving first as an instructor in an institution for training elementary teachers and later as the director of such an institution, he received a call to pastor a church in Mörs.
After ten years he left the church at Mörs to begin his own private educational institution.
[Theodor](bio.TheodorZahn) recorded in his autobiography that he never attended what we would term a public school, but received his training and preparation for higher education in private schools.
From his fifth to his ninth year he together with two older brothers was taught by a “house-teacher.”
In the winter of 1847–48 he translated the eight books of [Caesar](bio.cjuliuscaesar)’s Gallic Wars into German.
Aside from the usual classes, he received instruction in religion from his father.
Under the guidance of a Frenchman, he also spent two years learning French.
In the summer of 1854, he passed the secondary school examinations.
[Theodor](bio.TheodorZahn)’s father sent him to Basel to begin university studies in theology.
He stayed in a boarding house for theological students.
In addition to working in classical languages, he spent two years learning Hebrew.
He also began a study of church history under [Karl Rudolf Hagenbach](bio.karlrudolfhagenbach_1), who compelled his students to make purposeful use of the library of about ten thousand volumes.
[Hagenbach](bio.karlrudolfhagenbach_1)’s requirement of careful research on given topics resulted in [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s growing interest and later expertise in church history as reflected in his writings.
In New Testament studies [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) was especially influenced by [Christoph Johannes Riggenbach](bio.christophjohannesriggenbach_1), [Immanuel Stockmeyer](bio.immanuelstockmeyer_1), and [Johann Christian Konrad von Hofmann](bio.JohannHofmann).
In a study of the Gospels under [Riggenbach](bio.christophjohannesriggenbach_1), who through much struggle had become a dedicated Christian, [Theodor](bio.TheodorZahn) learned that it is important to discover the unique message of each of the Synoptics rather than stress only their similarities.
In classes on the Sermon on the Mount and on Galatians he learned much about proper exegetical methodology.
He also sat in on presentations on divine revelation, including [John](bk.#John)’s Book of Revelation.
While at home in the winter of 1855–56, he studied with growing interest [Hofmann](bio.JohannHofmann)’s careful theological study of Prophecy and Fulfilment.
At Easter in 1856 [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) went for three semesters to the University at Erlangen and studied under [Hofmann](bio.JohannHofmann).
He enjoyed [Hofmann](bio.JohannHofmann)’s concerned and winsome attention to individual students, which had a long-lasting effect on [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) in his later years.
Enriched and much influenced by the lectures of [Franz Delitzsch](bio.FranzDelitzsch), he spent a good deal of time making a careful study of detailed commentaries on both the Old and the New Testament.
Then he went to Berlin to complete his theological, homiletical, and practical studies.
From the fall of 1858 to 1861 [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) lived at home, preparing for the various licentiate and pro ministerio examinations.
During this period he suffered from a serious eye condition, necessitating an operation.
For a year he was not to read and write; then his eyesight improved.

## The Years of Service

In 1861 [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) began three-and-a-half years of service as a teacher at the gymnasium at Neustrelitz.
During his last two years there he taught religion as well as world history and German literature.
In the spring of 1865 [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) became a lecturer at the University of Göttingen, where lecturers were required to teach both Old and New Testament, church history, dogmatics, and ethics.
At that time [Albrecht Ritschl](bio.albrechtritschl) served as the dean of the theological faculty.
In the spring of 1868 [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) became a privatdozent, graduated with a doctorate, and passed several other requirements.
He also served as a university preacher.
On April 1, 1871, he was promoted to associate professor.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) expressed a desire to the theological faculty to begin lecturing on the books of the New Testament and the literature of the early church to around A.D. 450.
This necessitated that he learn Syriac.
During his twelve-year service at Göttingen, he wrote books on [Marcellus of Ancyra](bio.marcellusofancyra_1), the [Shepherd of Hermas](bio.shepherdhermas), and [Ignatius of Antioch](bio.IgnatiusAntioch.1).
He also edited in collaboration with [Oskar von Gebhardt](bio.oscarvongebhardt) and [Adolf von Harnack](bio.AdolfHarnack) the three-volume Patrum apostolicorum opera, to which he contributed Ignatii et Polycarpi epistulae, martyria, fragmenta.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s life as a lecturer at Göttingen became more difficult when colleagues began to teach his courses in New Testament exegesis.
The curator of the university informed him of the general view of the faculty: “As preacher you are absolutely necessary but as a professor superfluous.”
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s name was on a number of lists of potential professors, but he invariably received negative comments from those who did not share his approach.
Through the commendation of the curator at Göttingen, who did not share the general view, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) received a call in January 1877 to serve as a professor of New Testament at the University of Kiel.
On December 20, 1877, his former professor [Johann von Hofmann](bio.JohannHofmann) died.
On December 30, in fulfilment of [Hofmann](bio.JohannHofmann)’s wishes [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) was offered and accepted the position of dean of the theological faculty at Erlangen.
He was asked to teach the course in introductory knowledge and New Testament exegesis.
This subject area included both what we today term New Testament introduction and the principles of New Testament exegesis.
His second teaching area centered on the history of the New Testament canon and a deeper understanding of New Testament history.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s ongoing research from 1881 to 1916 resulted in a nine-volume work, Forschungen zur Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons und der altkirchlichen Literatur.
A number of the studies in this set were contributed by colleagues.
In [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s view the most helpful studies were the collection of [Tatian](bio.tatian)’s Diatessaron in the first volume and the Urausgabe der Apostelgeschichte des Lukas in the last volume.
At Erlangen [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) presented lectures and seminars on the exegesis of [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) through Revelation and stressed the educational and historical content of the New Testament.
Because of the large number of students, he began meeting with private groups in homes.
Some of the more gifted students later became colleagues at Erlangen and co-workers on commentaries on the books of the New Testament.
During his years of service at Göttingen, Kiel, and Erlangen, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) frequently preached in local churches.
He also made presentations on various facets of life in the church.
In doing so, he went beyond the usual boundaries of church history but without arousing negative reactions.
For example, he made a presentation on “Sklaverei and Christentum in der alten Welt” and published the book [Cyprian von Antiochien](bio.cyprianofantioch_1) und die deutschen Fasttage.
At the end of his first tenure at Erlangen, the first part of Zahn’s Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons (viz., Das Neue Testament vor Origenes) appeared.
In the fall of 1888 he became a member of the faculty at Leipzig, where he remained until Easter of 1892.
The final volume of the Geschichte appeared soon after his return to Erlangen in 1892.
Here he continued his teaching and writing activities, including a two-volume Einleitung in das Neue Testament.
He retired in 1909 but continued his study and writing.
He died at the age of ninety-five in 1933.

## Scholarly Visits Abroad

[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) made a number of trips abroad to make personal contact with scholars and institutions in various parts of Europe.  
In the fall of 1879 he traveled to “Venedy,” seemingly an old-German term for Venice, to do research in the Library of St. Mark on manuscripts of the Acta Joannis, legends about [John](bk.#John).
He studied Constantin Tischendorf’s copies of the Acta and excerpts from the Paris manuscripts.
During the Easter holiday in 1883 he examined manuscripts on [Cyprian of Antioch](bio.cyprianofantioch_1) among others.
He visited the Ambrosian Library at Milan and the Benedictine Library at Monte Cassino, south of Rome.
Only in September 1913, however, was he given the opportunity to study manuscripts at the Vatican.
As part of his ongoing research in various areas of patristics, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) carefully investigated the authenticity of the shortest Syrian translation of the letters of Ignatius and then wrote his monograph [Ignatius von Antiochien](bio.IgnatiusAntioch.1).
This received a favorable reaction from [J. B. Lightfoot](bio.JosephLightfoot), who remained in collegial contact with [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) for some years.
In 1897 [William Sanday](bio.williamsanday) was influential in arranging for Cambridge University to give special recognition to [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s achievements.
This permitted him to reestablish his relationship with [James Armitage Robinson](bio.jarmitagerobinson), [A. E. Brooke](bio.alanenglandbrooke_1), and [A. E. Burn](bio.aeburn).
It also afforded the privilege of getting to know [James Rendel Harris](bio.JamesHarris) and [Francis Crawford Burkitt](bio.FrancisBurkitt) personally.

## Views on the Canon of Scripture

[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s study of the canon of Scripture resulted in major publications: Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons and Forschungen zur Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons und der altkirchlichen Literatur.
This study involved very extensive research in patristics, in some instances the interrelationships between some of the writings of the early church.
Also of concern was the effect that the theological views of the writers had on what they wrote.
These topics were matters of ongoing debate in church history and theology at that time.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s research included a careful study of the Muratorian Canon, the oldest extant list of the writings of the New Testament.
The beginning and probably the end of the manuscript are missing, as a study of the content suggests.
In addition to most of the New Testament books it mentions the Apocalypse of [Peter](bk.#Peter) with a caveat; it rejects the [Shepherd of Hermas](bio.shepherdhermas), some of the Marcionite epistles, and other writings reflecting Gnosticism and Montanism.
The status of some of these works was being debated at the time of [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s studies and therefore needed careful review.
Among [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s sources in this research were the writings of [Origen](bio.Origen), including his canon; the Syriac Doctrine of [Addai](bio.addaiofedessa) (the traditional founder of the church at Edessa); the Diatessaron of [Tatian](bio.tatian); the Acts of [Paul](bk.#Paul); the canon of the Codex Claromontanus; the canon of [Cyril of Jerusalem](bio.CyrilJerusalem) (c. A.D. 350), the Cheltenham Canon (c. A.D. 360), the African canon (c. 360); the Roman canon of 382; the Syrian canon of 400; the thirty-ninth festal letter of [Athanasius](bio.AthanasiusAlexandria), which includes a list of the canonical writings of the Old and the New Testaments; and the writings of [Eusebius](bio.eusebiuscaesarea). [Bruce Metzger](bio.BruceMetzger)
[Bruce Metzger](bio.BruceMetzger) comments:
Still an indispensable mine of information are [Theodor Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s two volumes on the history of the New Testament canon, as well as the nine volumes of “Investigations” that he edited on various problems bearing on the canon.
A concise summary of [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s mature views on the canon, namely, that it came into existence by the end of the first century, is provided in his Grundriss der Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons.
[Harnack](bio.AdolfHarnack) criticized [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s reconstruction of the development of the canon.
According to [Harnack](bio.AdolfHarnack), the role of the church in the process of canonization was one of selection, whereas [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) stressed the concept of growth.
He understood the collection of the books of the New Testament to possess authority, but not on the grounds that the New Testament as such is Holy Scripture.
He felt, for example, that the four Gospels are authoritative because they contain the sayings of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
Hence in [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s view a New Testament canon was possible a century earlier than in [Harnack](bio.AdolfHarnack)’s view.

## Views on the Gospels and Acts

[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) edited a seventeen-volume commentary series on the New Testament, Kommentar zum Neuen Testament, to which a number of scholars contributed.
He himself wrote on seven of the New Testament books: [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) (1903), [Luke](bk.#Luke.1) (1913), [John](bio.john_1) (1908), Acts (2 vols., 1919, 1921), Romans (1910), Galatians (1905), and Revelation (2 vols., 1924, 1926).
Some of these are in the second or third edition.
None of them is available in English translation.
In discussing the Synoptic Gospels, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) adopted a position that was accepted by [Augustine](bio.AugustineHippo) and is common today.
The Gospel according to [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) was written by [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ disciple, who, before his call, had served as a tax collector.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s view was that the Greek version of [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) is a translation of the original Aramaic form of the Gospel.
This translation was influenced by the Greek Gospel of [Mark](bio.mark_1), which had previously been produced from the Aramaic form of [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1).
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) held that the lack of chronological order in [Mark](bio.mark_1) was due to dependence on the witness of [Peter](bk.#Peter), who was concerned to meet the needs of his hearers rather than to follow strict chronological sequence. [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) also felt that the “young man” who followed [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) from Gethsemane ( 14:51–52) is a reference to [Mark](bio.mark_1).
In his discussion of 1:1–4 [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) contends that [Theophilus](bk.#Theophilus.1) was not yet a Christian when [Luke](bk.#Luke.1) wrote his Gospel account.
On the other hand, the address to [Theophilus](bk.#Theophilus.1) in 1:1 may be an indication that in the interim he had become a Christian. [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) also suggests that [Luke](bk.#Luke.1) in his Gospel account and in Acts purposefully connected events with specific places in order to impress [Theophilus](bk.#Theophilus.1) with the trustworthiness of the Christian history.  
Another intriguing suggestion, this one based on the considerable differences between the Western text of Acts and the early texts, is that [Luke](bk.#Luke.1) himself may have prepared two editions of the Book of Acts.
In the light of his extensive studies of the writings of [John](bio.john_1) and the history of the early church, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) underlines that the Gospel account of [John](bio.john_1), the Epistles of [John](bk.#John), and Revelation are the work of the apostle [John](bk.#John):
The Johannine writings … originated in the province of Asia, and for this information we are not dependent upon tradition alone.
It is unmistakably affirmed in Revelation, and the tradition is entirely confirmed in this point by the contents of the Gospel and the Epistles.
In the same province also we find living until far on in the second century personal disciples of the [John of Ephesus](bio.johnofephesus) to whom these writings are ascribed.
Some of these are bishops, as [Papias](bio.PapiasHierapolis) in Hierapolis and [Polycarp](bio.Polycarp) in Smyrna; others are not mentioned by name, but [are] associated by [Irenaeus](bio.Irenaeus), the personal disciple of [Polycarp](bio.Polycarp), with [Papias](bio.PapiasHierapolis) and [Polycarp](bio.Polycarp), and called “the elders.” …
The fact that [John](bk.#John) lived to an extreme age and was still alive at the beginning of [Trajan](bio.trajan_1)’s reign (98–117), dying, therefore, about the year 100, and the fact that [Polycarp](bio.Polycarp) died in the year 155 (Feb. 23) at a very great age 86 years after his baptism, which must have taken place, therefore, in the year 69 give us an unbroken tradition from [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) to [Irenaeus](bio.Irenaeus), i.e., from 30 to 180, with only two links between them, namely, [John of Ephesus](bio.johnofephesus) and [Polycarp of Smyrna](bio.Polycarp).
This clear witness unfortunately is often ignored by some today, who posit instead the activity of a redactor.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) notes that one of the starting points for this view is the fact that the pericope about the adulterous woman ( 7:53–8:11) is not found in a number of the early manuscripts (P66, P75, Sinaiticus, and Vaticanus). [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s view was that John wrote this Gospel account for the benefit of Christians who were members of the churches under his care.
The intention of the Gospel of [John](bk.#John) was not to convert Gentiles and Jews to the Christian faith.
Rather, the purpose was to emphatically underline (e.g., through the references to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ miracles as signs) that [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) truly is the Son of [God](bk.#God), and that faith in him brings life in his name.

## Views on the Epistles

In his opening comments on [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s Letter to the Romans, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) stresses that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s first concern is to establish a proper connection between himself and the church in Rome.
Thus he begins by noting that he has been called to be an apostle set apart to proclaim God’s message of salvation, and that his readers’ conversion to faith in [Christ](bk.#Christ) has become known throughout the whole world.
He prays that his visit with them will result in strengthening their faith.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) points out that the church in Rome was dominantly Jewish.
Since Rome was also a center of the Judaistic propaganda that had plagued [Paul](bk.#Paul) in his previous missionary activity, the moral support of the Roman church was essential if his intended outreach in Spain ( 15:24, 28) was to be successful. [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) cites the Acts of [Peter](bk.#Peter) as clearly implying that Paul visited Spain between his two imprisonments.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s late dating of some of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s epistles causes him some trouble.
For example, he holds to the view that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s so-called captivity letters were written in Rome in the early 60s during what he terms [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s first imprisonment.
Yet his careful analysis of all the evidence indicates that these letters were most likely written during [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s stay in Ephesus between 52 and 55.
Who was the author of the Letter to the Hebrews?
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) carefully analyzes the suggestions that either [Paul](bk.#Paul) or [Barnabas](bk.#Barnabas) may have written this book.
He carefully demonstrates that both of these hypotheses are without proper evidence.
He feels that [Luther](bio.martinluther)’s suggestion of [Apollos](bk.#Apollos.1) has some merit, but in the end he concludes with [Origen](bio.Origen) that only [God](bk.#God) knows the answer.
That [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ half-brother [James](bk.#James.4) was the author of the Letter of [James](bk.#James.4) has been questioned by some on the grounds that [James](bk.#James.4) would not have had the knowledge of Greek evidenced in this letter.
But [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) argues that the reign of the Seleucids brought Greek to Palestine and hence to Galilee, through which ran the great trade routes of that time.
He concludes as have later historians that the people of Galilee were bilingual.
He joins others who place the writing of this letter before A.D. 50.
Whereas [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) believed that [Peter](bk.#Peter) wrote his first letter to Gentiles in Asia Minor, he held that the readers of 2 [Peter](bk.#Peter) were for the most part Jewish Christians in Palestine and in the adjoining regions.
He ruled out the areas north and northwest of Syrian Antioch.
In addition, denying that 2 **\_\_**3:1 refers to 1 [Peter](bk.#Peter), he suggested that 2 [Peter](bk.#Peter) was written earlier than 1 [Peter](bk.#Peter).  
And on the basis of close resemblances between the Letter of [Jude](bk.%Jude_Person) and 2 [Peter](bk.#Peter) (cf. 4 and 17–18 with 2 **\_\_**3:2–3), [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) also suggested that [Jude](bk.%Jude_Person) cited 2 [Peter](bk.#Peter).
In [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s view the apostle [John](bk.#John) is the author of 1–3 [John](bk.#John).  
Church tradition has generally held that the term presbyteros in 2 **\_**1 refers to the apostle [John](bk.#John).
[Eusebius](bio.eusebiuscaesarea), however, argued that [Papias](bio.PapiasHierapolis)’s reference to the truth as it had been declared by disciples of the Lord, including “the elder [John](bk.#John),” had in view a person other than the apostle.
In a detailed analysis [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) maintains that [Papias](bio.PapiasHierapolis) in using the term presbyteros was indeed referring to the apostle.
In this instance the term is perhaps best translated as “the ancient one,” for the apostle [John](bk.#John) reached a very old age.
The tradition that the apostle [John](bk.#John) wrote the Book of Revelation is very strong.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) points out that the apocalyptic language of Revelation is not a problem.
Because Revelation is a book of prophecy and visions, it is deeply influenced by Old Testament models.
Its style is necessarily different from that of [John](bk.#John)’s Gospel.
[Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) also provides very helpful information on what at times is a subject of intense debate, namely, whether the events described in Revelation are to be interpreted as historical and contemporary with the writing or as futuristic in nature.  
He points out that [Irenaeus](bio.Irenaeus) discarded the view that the number 666 should be interpreted as referring to a former or future Roman emperor.
“Genuine prophecy,” declares [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn), “contains much which lies outside the consciousness of the prophet himself, and will first become clear through its fulfillment.”
A leader of conservative New Testament critics, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) seems to have been overlooked by many who did not share his view of Scripture as the inspired Word of [God](bk.#God).
An additional problem is that his theological German is very elegant but at times very challenging to read.
Not surprisingly, then, most of his writings have not been translated into English.
But though most of his writings are challenging and have not been translated into English, [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) had a very great influence on the conservative theologians of his day.
And his students, through their teaching and writing on Scripture, especially the New Testament, as well as on the church fathers, later shared their inheritance from [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s teaching and writing.
Through their efforts many theologians of our day have been enriched by [Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn)’s achievements.

# [Adolf Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)/ [Robert W. Yarbrough](bio.robertwyarbrough)

Although hardly a household name even among specialists, [Adolf Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) ranks as one of the most productive and profound biblical scholars of modern times.
He was once relatively unknown in the English-speaking world because only a few of his writings had been translated.
But this situation is rapidly changing.
For sheer volume of output (he is credited with over 420 publications, 50 of them longer than a hundred pages) and breadth of expertise [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) takes a back seat to few biblical scholars.
A brief survey of his life will clarify the often difficult settings in which he carried out his work.
It will also set the stage for assessment of Schlatter’s significance for both church and academy today.

## Biographical Sketch

### Family Background and Schooling

[Adolf Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was born in Saint Gall, Switzerland, on August 16, 1852, the seventh of nine children.
His godly and theologically astute paternal grandmother, [Anna Bernet Schlatter](bio.annabernetschlatter_1) (1773–1826), bequeathed to her family a rich heritage: by 1935 six of her nine hundred descendants had become missionaries, and sixty-six had taken up theological study or other ministry-related vocations.
Besides [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter), one of them was the well-known New Testament and patristics scholar [Theodor Zahn](bio.TheodorZahn) (1838–1933).
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s own parents set a high example of Christian devotion.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s father [Stephan](bio.stephanschlatter_1) (1805–80), disillusioned with the nominalism and increasing liberalism of the Swiss state church, helped found an independent evangelical church in the late 1830s.
[Adolf](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s mother [Wilhelmine](bio.wilhelmineschlatter_1) (1819–94) remained in the Swiss Reformed Church, where [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) himself was confirmed and eventually ordained.
His parents’ loyalty to [Christ](bk.#Jesus) and each other despite differing ecclesial commitments encouraged an ecumenical openness in [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) that would mark his entire life.
In the home [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) received not only spiritual nurture but also intellectual encouragement.
His father, who had studied pharmaceutics, passed on his interest in the natural world to his children.
Late in life the outdoors-loving [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was still able to give a public discourse on Alpine flora, so solid was his early exposure to botany.
In school he received the highest possible marks in all subjects.
These included five foreign languages, among them Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s Greek teacher [Franz Misteli](bio.franzmisteli_1) encouraged his gifted young charge to become a professional philologist.
But in the end, encouraged by his mother and challenged by his sister [Lydia](bio.lydiaschlatter_1), [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) selected theology as his major field of university study.
His first four semesters at the University of Basel (1871–73) were largely devoted to philosophy, as was the custom in pastoral training of the day.
Intellectual problems posed by the Christian faith weighed heavily on [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter), whose letters home alarmed his family.
He joined an academically oriented student group, not the pietistic one recommended by his mother.
His letters from that time hint at a crisis of conviction familiar to many students.
The tempered faith that emerged following those years was not cheaply won.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) took special interest in [Spinoza](bio.baruchspinoza) and [Aristotle](bio.Aristotle).
[Kant](bio.ImmanuelKant) and [Hegel](bio.GeorgHegel) were likewise focal points of study.
He heard [Friedrich Nietzsche](bio.FriedrichNietzsche) lecture on [Plato](bio.plato), but the impression was not positive.
Years later he recalled chiefly [Nietzsche](bio.FriedrichNietzsche)’s “offensive haughtiness.
He treated his listeners like despicable peons.
He convinced me of the principle that to throw out love is to despoil the business of teaching only genuine love can really educate.”
For three semesters [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) moved to the famous university town of Tübingen in Germany, where he was especially struck by the intense lectures of biblical theologian [Johann Tobias Beck](bio.johanntobiasbeck).
He then returned to Basel, where in 1875 he passed all his oral and written exams with the highest possible marks.
His basic preparation for the ministry was complete.

### Pastor-Scholar

Although encouraged by a Basel professor to pursue further academic work leading to a teaching chair, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) felt called to parish ministry.
From 1875 to 1880 he served with distinction in several Swiss state churches.
In 1878 he married [Susanna Schoop](bio.susannaschoop_1); they would eventually have five children.
In 1880, reluctant to leave the pastorate, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) responded with trepidation to a request that he pursue a university post in the Swiss city of Bern.
He knew that the liberal university faculty would seek to block the appointment of a conservative candidate like him.
Indeed, when [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) arrived and paid a courtesy visit to an influential faculty member, he was brusquely informed that he might as well pack his bags and leave town.
But he persevered, submitting as his doctoral dissertation a study of [John the Baptist](bk.#JohntheBaptist) which showed a high level of technical mastery.
The faculty, hoping to bar his way despite his acceptable dissertation, responded by amassing a special set of exams for [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter).
But he never faltered in the course of the eight written and five oral exams to which he was subjected.
No other faculty candidate had to endure this ordeal either before or after [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s candidacy.
He was appointed to lecture in New Testament exegesis and historical theology.
Faculty relations were much less strained in the northern German university at Greifswald, to which [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was called in 1888.
In fact, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) here enjoyed an idyllic five years of service in close cooperation with the renowned Greek lexicographer [Hermann Cremer](bio.hermanncremer) (1834–1903).
His appointment was to teach both New Testament and systematic theology.
His publications attracted job offers from universities in Bonn, Basel, Heidelberg, and Marburg, but he remained in Greifswald until 1893.
At that time he accepted a call to the University of Berlin, where controversy raged over [Adolf von Harnack](bio.AdolfHarnack)’s criticism of the Apostles’ Creed.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter), who accepted a systematics chair with permission to teach New Testament topics as well, was expected to provide a theological counterweight.
Despite their contrasting outlooks, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) and [Harnack](bio.AdolfHarnack) enjoyed a friendly relationship.
During his Berlin years (1893–98)
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was also active in church and mission work, serving on the board of the Berlin East Africa (later Bethel) Mission and assisting various Christian student organizations.

### Professor in Tübingen (1898–1922)

In 1898 [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) with his wife and five children made their last major move to Tübingen in southwest Germany.
He was assigned to lecture in New Testament and systematics.
His practical involvement in conference speaking and student ministries grew steadily.
Shunned at first by the local students, who followed [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s colleagues in considering him too pious and uncritical, he eventually gained respect and even favor with his gripping lectures (delivered without notes), numerous publications, and popularity among students from elsewhere who flocked to hear him.
Archival sources abound with details from these years; a recurring theme is student awe at [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s ability to quote lengthy biblical texts from memory in the original languages.
It is reported that he knew the Greek text of the New Testament by heart.
As [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) neared the usual years of peak academic productivity, his wife Susanna died suddenly in 1907 at the age of fifty-one.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was devastated but continued his work with the help of daughters [Hedwig](bio.hedwigschlatter_1) and [Dora](bio.doraschlatter_1), who with their mother’s passing took over household responsibilities for their father, remaining unmarried till their deaths.
They were ably assisted by [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s older son, [Theodor](bio.theodorschlatter_1).
Life’s end was suddenly palpably near to [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) as he approached sixty, and books began to stream from his pen with astonishing speed.
In the seven years after his wife’s death he wrote four major works totaling two thousand pages, to say nothing of fifty more articles and essays.
Large numbers of students crowded into his lectures; in 1912–13 class records put attendance at 231 for his [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) lectures, 141 for his theological introduction, and 123 for Romans.
And he had by no means reached the peak of his Tübingen popularity.
The opening months of the First World War brought the bitter news of the battlefield death of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s son [Paul](bio.paulschlatter_1), who at the war’s onset was writing a dissertation on [Napoleon](bio.napoleonbonaparte_1).
The years of the war and its aftermath saw the volume of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s literary activity slacken, in part because of sorrow over his son, in part because of grief over the mounting battlefield slaughter, and in part because of heavy involvement in practical student, lay, and civic ministry.
More than two thousand letters from pastors, students, and laypersons of all ages who wrote to him after hearing him preach or teach at various conferences have survived.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was privately sickened by the war, in whose bloody glare his academic work seemed to him for a time like a sacrilege.
Yet with war-torn Germany, like all of Europe, suddenly overwhelmed with large numbers of grieving mothers and widows, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) spoke often to women’s groups, and in 1921 he was the supervisor for [Lydia Schmidt](bio.lydiaschmidt_1), the first woman to achieve the rank of theological licentiate in the German Protestant church.

### Active Retirement (1922–38)

Retirement was mandatory for [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) in 1922 at age seventy.
In that same year he penned a review of [Karl Barth](bio.KarlBarth)’s Romans commentary, which marked the beginning of a new theological era.
It was an era in which [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) remained active.
He made use of his right to offer university lectures and seminars as professor emeritus and continued to teach until 1930, when he ceased after exactly one hundred consecutive semesters of classroom labor.
His emeritus lectures drew sufficient numbers of students to fill a hall seating more than seven hundred.
He spoke at various annual meetings and conferences.
He was also active politically, attempting to give biblical direction to his country’s desperate attempts to piece together a better social order in the difficult Weimar years (1919–33).
While [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s theology did not conflate church and state, he urged a vibrant, bold, and well-informed participation of Christians in social and political matters.
Capping a life of remarkable productivity, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s publications from 1929 when he turned seventy-seven till his death in 1938 bespeak the joy of living, remarkable energy, and iron discipline.
In rapid succession he produced nine critical commentaries that together amount to more than four thousand pages.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) published two thousand pages, most of a scholarly nature, in 1930–32 alone.
(See figure 1 for English translations of the titles of some of his major works, including the nine New Testament critical commentaries.)
In addition, ministry to students continued unabated, not only in public lectures but in small groups that met weekly in [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s home.
These “open evenings” were a fixture in [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s life for forty-eight years (1888–1936).
Students from any field of study were invited and encouraged to raise pressing issues.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) would enter the living room promptly at eight, cigar box in hand, greet each student, and then begin fielding questions.
At ten o’clock the evening was over.
Schlatter was known for his gentleness toward the meek and struggling.
He likewise dealt with insincerity and cheek in an appropriate manner.

[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) also made time for one-on-one talks.
Though in his last two years he was virtually homebound, he conferred with individual visitors until the last semester before his death.
This continued a practice, unheard of for a German university professor, that had always been a part of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s academic schedule: he was available one hour each day to meet with students.
German theologian [Karl Heinrich Rengstorf](bio.karlheinrichrengstorf_1) suggests that in this custom [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was utterly unique among his peers, for whom one hour per week would have been typical.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s last major work was a penetrating devotional guide called Kennen wir [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)?
(Do we know [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)?)
containing 366 meditations (Feb. 29 is included).
First published in 1937, it bears the stamp of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s opposition to the National Socialist (Nazi) ideology that had by then inundated his adopted homeland.
It also highlights his conviction of [Jesus Christ](bk.#Jesus)’s central significance for both individual and social survival: “Do we know [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)?
If we lose the knowledge of him, we have lost track of our own identity.”  
On the same page [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) makes it clear that he fears his German countrymen have indeed traded their culture’s Christian heritage for a mess of neopagan pottage.
He thus ended his life in the same fashion that he had tirelessly expended it: calling hearers and readers to the sovereign reality of [God](bk.#God)’s presence in the world and the redemptive necessity of the gospel of [Christ](bk.#Christ).
He died peacefully on May 19, 1938.

## Modern Neglect of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)

A striking picture emerges from even a cursory survey of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s life and thought.
Along with this picture emerges a pressing question: why did [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s voluminous and painstaking academic work have so little impact on German theological thought?
One reason is the difficulty of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s language.
His Swiss accent and often energetic style of delivery made for difficult listening.
His general policy of never composing two sentences when he could get by with one renders his writings dauntingly complex at times.
Another reason is his failure to have built personal bridges to academic opponents as effectively as he might: in personal writings he confessed that perhaps his greatest sin was his poor relations with colleagues.
In fairness to [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter), his writings were attacked and sometimes cheaply ridiculed by peers, among them the influential [Emil Schürer](bio.emilschurer).
But [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s own perception that his response, especially in his younger years, was not always as measured as it might have been was not groundless.
Yet it was the content, not the mode, of his communication that caused many of his academic peers to neglect [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s studies and proposals.
[Werner Neuer](bio.wernerneuer_1) lists ten ways in which [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s scholarship ran against the grain of his times:

1.  He affirmed metaphysics and proofs for [God](bk.#God)’s existence as constituent parts of Christian dogmatics.
2.  He rejected Kantian epistemology and ethics.
3.  He proposed instead a theology and ethics that were empirical, realist, and biblical in nature, not rationalist and idealist as had been prevalent in post-Enlightenment liberal Protestantism.
4.  He had high regard for creation and nature as revelatory components of [God](bk.#God)’s self-disclosure; he also affirmed the concept of natural law.
5.  Accordingly, he rejected the Barthian reduction of the scope of [God](bk.#God)’s self-disclosure to the solitary point of [Jesus Christ](bk.#Jesus).
6.  He carefully criticized post-Reformation theology for succumbing to intellectualism and failing to move beyond the admittedly all-important doctrine of faith alone to the equally crucial ethical results of vital faith.
    He traced the roots of these unfortunate developments back to the Reformation itself.
7.  He sharply demarcated his own theological outlook from the successive critical orthodoxies of his lifetime: rationalistic liberalism, Ritschlian liberalism, Troeltschian Kulturprotestantismus, dialectical theology.
8.  He did not facilely join himself to an existing theological school, nor did he found one.
9.  He resisted the move of many of his conservative contemporaries toward a simplistic repristination of confessionalism.
10. He incorporated many insights of the obscure early neo-Thomist, Roman Catholic philosopher [Franz von Baader](bio.franzxavervonbaader) (1765–1841), whose insights (gleaned in part from [Kant](bio.ImmanuelKant)’s nemesis [Johann Hamann](bio.johannhamann_1)) were of considerable importance to [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) in the years immediately following his university training.
    [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was by no means without influence or followers in his time.
    Two generations of pastors gleaned guidance from his teaching.
    And academicians like [Paul Althaus](bio.PaulAlthaus) and [Wilhelm Lütgert](bio.wilhelmlutgert_1), former [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) students, contributed greatly to theological scholarship.
    Consider also that [Hans Emil Weber](bio.hansemilweber_1), [Emil Brunner](bio.EmilBrunner), [Dietrich Bonhoeffer](bio.DietrichBonhoeffer), and more recently [Otto Michel](bio.ottomichel_1) owed much to [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter).
    A modern theologian has called [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s writings a Steinbruch (quarry) from which many have freely borrowed.
    And he remains the most-read German theologian of his generation no one else born in the 1830–60 time span even approximates the number of his works in print.
    Yet to some degree [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was coolly received by both critical and conservative forces because his creatively independent outlook made each camp suspect him of supporting the other.
    Conservatives who might have had the will to push [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s views were fragmented and ineffective (in twentieth-century Germany and North America, conservatives lost their determinative influence in their cultures’ major intellectual institutions), while certain influential critical thinkers of the 1920s rushed onto the bandwagon of dialectical theology.
    To the present hour [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) remains a marginal figure on the German theological scene not because his ideas have been sifted and proven unworkable, but because the clamor of dialectical theology and subsequent movements, along with the passing of several decades, has made it convenient to proceed as if Schlatter’s pointed criticisms of modernism’s theological implications have been discredited.
    But these criticisms retain force in the postmodern setting.
    Thus it is that [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s achievement remains virtually unappropriated, and largely unacknowledged, even on the German-speaking scene, though scholars like the late [Klaus Bockmühl](bio.klausbockmuhl_1), [Peter Stuhlmacher](bio.peterstuhlmacher), [Werner Neuer](bio.wernerneuer_1), and [Rainer Riesner](bio.rainerreisner_1) have begun to strip back the prevailing veil of ignorance.
    [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s pioneering insights continue to hold promise for future hermeneutical and theological initiatives.

## [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) as Biblical Scholar

Without detracting from [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s importance in such fields as theology, ethics, and philosophy, it must be said that he was primarily an exegete.
About 75 percent of his fifty longer writings (over one hundred pages) are devoted to the study of the New Testament or its historical setting, especially Judaism of the intertestamental, New Testament, and post–New Testament eras.
A number of characteristics of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s exegetical contribution deserve mention.

### Philological Rigor

Philology is the detailed study of literature, language, and linguistics.
While liberal theological colleagues attacked [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s exegesis for its alleged lack of scholarly depth, the philosophy faculty of the University of Berlin was closer to the mark.
In 1932, on the occasion of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s eightieth birthday, when a number of his critical commentaries had already appeared, it granted [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) an honorary doctorate with the following commendation: “The faculty honors in [Professor von Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) the proponent and upholder of a Philologia sacra [sacred philology] in the venerable ancient sense, which [philology] moves upward from a precise and accurate understanding of the linguistic and historical to a vital and enlivening overarching conception of the New Testament tradition.”
Evidence of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s command of philological detail may be found in both the text and appendix of his commentary on [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1), where hundreds of Semitic parallels to [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1)’s usage are cited.
The commentary on [John](bk.#John) is even more striking with its nineteen pages of painstakingly detailed word-lists: Semitic parallels to [John](bk.#John)’s Gospel, parallels to [Josephus](bio.FlaviusJosephus) in [John](bk.#John)’s Gospel, Johannine words absent from [Josephus](bio.FlaviusJosephus), parallels between [John](bio.john_1)’s Gospel and [John](bio.john_1)’s Apocalypse (both of which [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) held were written by [John the son of Zebedee](bk.#John)), and Johannine words absent from [John](bio.john_1)’s Apocalypse ([Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) counts a total of twenty).
Also notable in this connection are the twenty (unpublished but preserved in archives) volumes of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s handwritten notes on [Josephus](bio.FlaviusJosephus), including a two-volume concordance that he compiled from his own reading, further evidence of the philological rigor for which [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) strove.

### Focus on the Primary Text

Until late in life when his critical commentaries appeared, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) was accused of ignoring the work of other scholars.
The ground for this charge lay in the fact that his writings (with the exception of his dogmatics volume) were not packed with the dense masses of footnotes conventional in modern scholarly monographs.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s response to this charge was twofold.
First, he self-effacingly claimed that early in his career he realized he would have to choose between being expert in the ancient sources and being expert in modern critical opinion.
He chose the former.
Second, he stated repeatedly that his passion was to examine the historical, philological, and theological details of the texts he studied, not to grope for direction in the obscuring fog that the antitheological conjectures of his colleagues produced.
He conceded the obvious value of familiarity with current theories and his writings bristle with implicit evidence that he was aware of his colleagues’ views.
But he was also aware that our “hearing [of the text] is imperiled when at the same time we are stormed by a jumble of voices.
Stillness is the condition for hearing; it demands restricting our communion to the one who now speaks to us.”
Secondary sources can broaden the interpreter’s horizon, but they can as easily becloud it.

### Scholarship in Service of the Gospel

[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) lived in the heyday of liberal Protestantism.
Institutions that had once served the church for example, university theology faculties that trained pastors now tended to see their task as freeing the church from old-fashioned beliefs like [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ divinity, his substitutionary atonement, his bodily resurrection, and the Bible’s entire and normative veracity.
In many cases pastors were trained accordingly.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) resisted this trend, not in a reactionary but in a progressive manner.
He placed his literary ability at the service of lay and pastoral readers as he wrote his best-known works, Erläuterungen zum Neuen Testament (New Testament expositions), a ten-volume (often bound in three volumes)
running commentary on the entire New Testament.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) is the sole New Testament scholar of stature to achieve some would say stoop to this feat in the twentieth century.
He toiled to let Scripture, not just modern dismissals of it, be heard, refusing to enthrone as the church’s normative leaders academicians sporting unsatisfactory innovations: “Leadership of the church does not belong to the theologians; they are not the sole agent of the one who alone rules and builds churches.”
This does not mean that trained academicians have no role in the church their service is desperately needed but they must be willing to cultivate contacts with pastoral and lay leaders and to labor at practical acts of Christian love.
And they must not be overly enamored of the fashions that sweep academe and sometimes subvert Christian scholarship.
(Already in the late 1920s
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s exposure to [Rudolf Bultmann](bio.RudolfBultmann)’s books and at least one lecture led him to fear that [Bultmann](bio.RudolfBultmann) was headed in the direction of “an atheistic interpretation of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).”)
In theological education [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) believed in engaging the hearts, not just the minds of students.
His goal was to train them in “independent reading of Holy Scripture and theological literature” rather than in swallowing whole the opinions of their teachers.
The pastoral office calls for “wide-awake observers … not men who are blinded by their fixed ideas.” [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) also emphasized that a healthy fear of [God](bk.#God) is requisite to theological training and discussion; theology is “not only a matter of intellectual precision but also, and even more, of the inner disposition of the person toward [God](bk.#God).”
In all of this [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) maintained the highest academic standards and methodological rigor.
In serving church interests he did not dilute the legitimate demands of scholarship.
He refused to allow dogmatic liberalism, or existentialist-oriented dialectical theology, to dictate the content and significance of the ancient biblical sources.
And he just as adamantly refused to let dogmatic conservatism short-circuit the need for perennial scholarly scrutiny of the biblical sources historically understood as a basis for ongoing personal, doctrinal, and ultimately social renewal.

### Attention to Jewish Backgrounds

One of the most important hallmarks of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s biblical scholarship was his attention to Jewish backgrounds.
Many of his academic peers were heavily indebted to philosophical idealism and tended to see ancient Judaism and pure Christianity in antithetical terms.
Historical research sometimes became a matter of finding parallels to the New Testament in non-Jewish sources, and then theorizing how these non-Jewish ideas, however remote temporally or geographically, came to appear in the Semitic-sounding books of the New Testament.
A whole interpretive school formed around this enterprise: the [Religionsgeschichtliche Schule](bk.%ReligionsgeschichtlicheSchule) (history-of-religions school).
Typical of its approach were its explanations of central aspects of [John](bio.john_1)’s Gospel on the basis of ideas found in Greek and Hellenistic sources such as [Plato](bio.plato) and [Philo](bio.philoalexandria).
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) demurred: “If we surround [the New Testament] with pieces of background which contradict its clear statements, we are making historical research into a work of fiction.
In my view, New Testament theology only fulfills its obligations by observation, not by free creation.” [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) argued for a Palestinian origin of [John](bio.john_1)’s Gospel.
In both technical monographs and his critical commentary on [John](bio.john_1), [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) advanced extensive linguistic and historical arguments to support his view.
He went largely unheeded in his lifetime but was vindicated after Dead Sea Scroll discoveries in the late 1940s bore out his contentions about the Palestinian flavor of the fourth Gospel.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s attention to the Semitic dimensions of the New Testament did not, however, cause him to ignore Hellenism’s ubiquitous presence in first-century Palestine.
For example, the first volume of his New Testament theology details the similarities and differences between [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ and Hellenistic thought.
Volume 2 likewise carefully notes the distinctives of Greek culture in its interplay with the gospel.
To say that [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) paid attention to Jewish thought is not to say that he gave short shrift to Greek ideas.
It is simply to point out that he noted not only similarities between New Testament language and Hellenistic sources, but also differences.
These differences had to be accounted for, and [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) found that the most likely sources were often Jewish and Old Testament background material.
In recent years [E. P. Sanders](bio.epsanders) has called attention to the distortions of ancient Judaism that plagued New Testament scholarship in the past.
Today both Gospel and Pauline studies are marked by pronounced emphasis on, and positive assessment of, the New Testament’s Jewish features.
While the pendulum has swung too far in this direction in some quarters, the current trend is an improvement over the covert, and sometimes overt, anti-Semitism of past scholarship.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) deserves credit for anticipating this trend.
His laborious and, at the time, lonely forays into the labyrinths of rabbinic thought and Jewish history mark him as a true pioneer.
Modern New Testament historians like the late [F. F. Bruce](bio.FFBruce) and [Martin Hengel](bio.martinhengel) have continued to show the fruitfulness of this approach, enlarging the foundation that [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) laid.

### A Method Open to the Transcendent

In the past two hundred years scholars have embarked on various quests for the historical [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
This means the [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) found by applying certain critical theories to the Gospel traditions.
These theories have tended to deny that the New Testament writings taken as unified wholes have as much insight to offer into the historical [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) as do modern scholars with their latest claims and methods.
On the basis of isolated New Testament (or extrabiblical) passages the real [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) is argued to have been a political revolutionary, a wandering sage, a cynical social critic, or even a magician, instead of the [Son of God](bk.#Jesus), the sacrifice for sin, and giver of eternal life in a word, the [Messiah](bk.#Jesus) that the New Testament writings in their entirety present.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter), on the other hand, believed that “there is no ground for the hope that we can arrive at a ‘historical’ [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) after we have rejected the statements of all his disciples [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1), [John](bk.#John), [Paul](bk.#Paul), and with them the entirety of early Christendom.”
His researches confirmed for him that [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) was indeed the messianic deliverer of Old Testament promise.
This led him to argue that scholarship goes astray in dogmatically rejecting the material presence of [God](bk.#God) in the space-time world.
Such banning of [God](bk.#God) from the phenomenal realm has dominated Protestant theology since [Kant](bio.ImmanuelKant).
But by adamantly rejecting even the possibility of such Christian affirmations as the incarnation, [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ ontological unity with [God](bk.#God), and history’s capacity to serve as vehicle for the transcendent, scholars, instead of soberly observing and investigating the realities to which the New Testament writers point, risk embarking on a blind and partisan dispute with them.
It is acceptable, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) conceded, to employ a method informed by the theory that certain data can be accounted for without resorting to [God](bk.#God) or divine causation as an essential explanatory factor.
This is the classic etsi Deus non daretur (as if [God](bk.#God) did not exist) premise, the assumption that phenomena can be explained solely with reference to immanent causation.
As a heuristic tool this premise has value, even for biblical studies.
The trouble arises when the tool moves from a methodological premise, a consciously adopted angle of vision, to a dogmatically held postulate.
Then the danger of rationalism arises: “Where judgment cuts loose from the perception which is indispensable to it, where the intellect’s productive power tries to be in command and play the creator so that what we produce is no longer connected with a prior receiving, where thought circles around one’s own self, as though this could create from itself the material from which knowledge comes and the rules by which it is to be judged, there we have rationalism.
It stands in irreconcilable hostility to the very basis of the New Testament, because acknowledging [God](bk.#God) is the direct opposite of rationalism.
But this rationalism is at the same time the road to dreamland and the death of intellectual integrity.”
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) opposed such rationalism on both theological and scientific grounds.
While methodological atheism is reasonable in the pluralistic sphere of academic inquiry, dogmatic atheism is the enemy of true science, to say nothing of religion.
Much of [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s work represents a challenge, and constructive alternative, to the covert intellectual totalitarianism that results when dogmatic atheism prevails, causing damage to both scholarship and church interests.
One of the most important potential results of the renewed attention to [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) is that current biblical scholarship may develop a sharper awareness of the ideological underpinnings that inform allegedly neutral methods.
In Germany, [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) studies, while not a torrent, are appearing with gratifying frequency.
In English-speaking circles familiarity with [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter) is rapidly growing.
A recent monograph by [Stephen Dintaman](bio.stephendintaman_1) and a translation of [Werner Neuer](bio.wernerneuer_1)’s important short biography are promising signs.
So is the appearance of his hefty two-volume New Testament theology.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s writings hold rich potential for summoning serious biblical scholarship back to its classic sources, methods, and aims.
In today’s fragmented academic climate a voice of informed and independent moderation based on comprehensive and sympathetic observation of the Bible is much needed.
[Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s work instructively upholds the historic Christian ideal of balanced erudition committed to the task of letting [Christ](bk.#Jesus) and Scripture grace lost humankind and rule the church with their truth and light.
Time marches on; but [Schlatter](bio.AdolfSchlatter)’s observations, proposals, and methodological insights many still waiting to be recovered will retain their relevance for the foreseeable future.

[Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) was born on February 4, 1856.
Perhaps what [Robert](bio.RobertWilson.1) was to become could be seen in part from the fact that his father, a leading merchant in the town of Indiana, Pennsylvania, was a man of culture and taste.
He was president of the board of trade in his county and president of the local school board.
He was able to give his attention to all of these ventures along with the ten children in his home.
Already at the age of four [Robert Dick](bio.RobertWilson.1) could read.
He began school at the age of five, and at eight he had read, among many other books, the Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World, a ponderous work by the archeologist [George Rawlinson](bio.georgerawlinson).
Further evidence of a great appetite for learning and books is an episode that occurred when he was nine.
He and his brother accompanied their father on a rather long journey for those days from their home near Pittsburgh to Philadelphia.
As [Robert Dick](bio.RobertWilson.1) later recounted, the most exciting part of that trip was a visit to a bookstore on Chestnut Street, where their father left the boys for a while so that they could select their own books.
He was startled to discover, upon returning, that they had gathered about fifty volumes, including such “light reading” as [Prescott](bio.oliverprescotthiller_1), [Robertson](bio.FrederickWRobertson), [J. S. C. Abbott](bio.johnscabbott_1), and similar standard works.
Having completed public school in Indiana, Pennsylvania, [Robert](bio.RobertWilson.1) was ready at the age of fourteen to begin his collegiate experience at the College of New Jersey (later renamed Princeton University).
However, he did not enter that year, but waited until he was seventeen years old.
He later explained the reason for this delay: “I had a good deal of headache[s] between my fourteenth and twentieth years, and then typhoid.
After that my headache[s] disappeared.
I really couldn’t half do my work before that.”
In college [Robert](bio.RobertWilson.1) specialized in language study, psychology, and mathematics.
He would one day in retrospect express embarrassment that a low grade of 90 in one of his Bible courses had pulled down his average.
His real love seemed to be language study.
He had prepared himself for college by studying French, German, and Greek.
Because [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) had made up his mind that he wanted to study the classics in the original languages, his habit was to take a grammar book with him when he went on a walk.
When he stopped for a rest, he would study for a bit and learn what he could.
His friends claimed he had a remarkably retentive memory.
His procedure for working through a grammar proved remarkably successful:
I would read a grammar through, look up the examples, making notes as I went along, and I wouldn’t pass by anything until I could explain it.
I never learned long lists of words, but I would read a page through, recall the words I didn’t know, and then look them up.
I read anything I thought would be interesting to me if it were in English.
I got so interested in the story that I was unconscious of the labor as a man is interested in his roses, and he doesn’t think of the thorns.
So I learned Greek, Latin, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Biblical Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic, and so on.
Using this method, he eventually mastered twenty-six languages and dialects.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) graduated from the College of New Jersey in 1876 with an A.B.; in 1879 he received his A.M.
Having in the meantime been licensed by the Kittanning Presbytery, he began holding evangelistic services in places like Cherry Tree, Burnside, Bethel, Mechanicsburg, and Armagh.
During most of this time, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) was an assistant to [Alexander Donaldson](bio.alexanderdonaldson_1) of Elder’s Ridge, Pennsylvania.
Prior to his entering seminary, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) and his brother devoted approximately a year and a half to the work of evangelism in the town of Indiana.
The response was so encouraging that [Robert](bio.RobertWilson.1) would have taken up the work of an evangelist had not his studies caused him to perceive that there was a great need for a type of biblical scholarship that would deal objectively with the evidence.
While holding meetings at Cherry Tree, he purchased a Hebrew Bible and a Hebrew dictionary and grammar that were written in Latin.
Through studying these books, he won a prize for Hebrew upon entering Western Theological Seminary (Pittsburgh).
In the years 1881–83 [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) did research in Semitic languages at the University of Berlin.
There he concentrated on Assyriology under [Eberhard Schrader](bio.eberhardschrader_1), [August Dillmann](bio.augustdillmann), and [Eduard Sachau](bio.eduardsachau_1).
It was during his student days in Germany that [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) designed a plan for his life.
He believed it would be well for him to divide his career into three blocks of fifteen years each.
Not many young men would design a forty-five-year program for themselves, but that is another indication of the unique quality of the man.
The first fifteen years would be spent studying the original languages of the Bible and various cognate tongues.
During the second fifteen years he would focus on biblical textual matters in the light of his philological studies.
His hope was to spend the last fifteen years in writing what he had learned.
After Berlin, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) returned to Western Theological Seminary, where he served as an instructor (1883–85) and then as a professor of Old Testament (1885–1900).
He was ordained in 1885, and received his Ph.D. from the College of New Jersey in 1886.
Having risen to the position of head of the Department of Old Testament History and Hebrew, he left in 1900 to take a similar position at Princeton Theological Seminary.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) served at Princeton until 1929.
He loved the classroom; his material was fresh, and his pedagogical methods were never stereotyped.
Whether the subject was Hebrew or a refutation of some new theory of the higher critics, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) threw himself into the lectures with enthusiasm.
“For a number of years at Princeton he gave the new students a lecture on the importance of Hebrew.
He called it his ‘Cui Bono?’
(i.e., ‘What’s the Use [of Hebrew]?’) lecture.
And it became an institution; upperclassmen who had heard the lecture once or twice already would come to hear Dr. [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) enlarge upon a theme so dear to his heart.”

## Writings

By the time [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) died in his seventy-fifth year, most of his forty-five-year program had been achieved.
He had familiarized himself with twenty-six languages, including Assyrian and Babylonian cuneiform, Ethiopic, Phoenician, various Aramaic dialects, Egyptian, Coptic, Persian, Arabic, Syriac, and Hebrew.
He also had published thirty-six major articles and fifteen book reviews in the Princeton Theological Review and at least four monographs on key critical issues of the day.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s scholarship was often extremely technical, and therefore had little appeal to the general audience.
He did very little work in exegesis per se and did not much enter into theological discussion.
Serious students of the Bible who are acquainted with his written legacy are, however, quick to acknowledge that his defense of the Word of [God](bk.#God) remains challenging and instructive even to this day.
While still at Western Theological Seminary, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) published his Introductory Syriac Method and Manual (1891), which was modeled after [William Rainey Harper](bio.WilliamHarper)’s Introductory Hebrew Method and Manual.
The brief Notes on Hebrew Syntax (1892) soon followed.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s inaugural address upon being appointed by Princeton Seminary to the prestigious chair named after [William Henry Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was delivered on September 21, 1900, and published the next year under the title The Lower Criticism of the Old Testament as a Preparation for the Higher Criticism (1901).
Next came his Illustrations of [Gesenius](bio.justusgesenius)’ Hebrew Grammar with Vocabularies (1906) and his Hebrew Grammar for Beginners (1908).
Even though [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) had not been trained at Princeton Seminary, he became a champion of its theology and a defender of its conservative stance on critical matters.
Given his expertise in Semitic philology, in ancient Near Eastern history, literature, and archeology, and in the general movements of contemporary Old Testament scholarship, he was able to mount one of the most successful defenses of the conservative position on many of the critical issues that were in the forefront of Old Testament scholarship in the first third of the twentieth century.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) recognized that some of the most significant battles centered on the Book of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel): its miracles, history, and prophecies.
It was his conviction that if one maintained a clear conservative view on this book of the Bible, one would remain conservative on other matters as well.  
Not surprisingly, then, it was for his [Daniel](bk.#Daniel) studies that [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) earned his reputation as one of the leading conservative voices of Old Testament scholarship.
In the first volume of Studies in the Book of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel) (1917) he concludes that the charges and methods of the critics are “illogical, irrational, and unscientific.
They are illogical because they beg the question at issue.
They are irrational because they assume that historic facts are self-evident, and that they can set limits to the possible.
They are unscientific because they base their conclusions on incomplete inductions and on a practical claim of omniscience.”  
The second planned volume, which was to have dealt specifically with the linguistic problems of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel), was never written, but the third planned volume was published first as a series of articles in the Princeton Theological Review and then as volume 2 of Studies in the Book of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel) (1938).
By this time most scholars had already accepted a Maccabean date for the Book of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel) as set forth by [S. R. Driver](bio.SamuelDriver)’s Book of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel) (1900).  
However, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s early dating of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel) did attract the attention of Semitic philologists and some Old Testament scholars.
A clear example of [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s approach is the hard linguistic argument that he aimed directly at [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver)’s thesis that the Persian, Greek, and Aramaic words in the Book of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel) either presuppose, permit, or demand a date after the conquest of Palestine by [Alexander the Great](bk.#AlexanderGreat) (332 b.c.).
So stung was [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver) by the challenge that he included a rejoinder to [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) in the ninth edition of his Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament.
[Driver](bio.SamuelDriver) was most incensed that [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) had not represented his position fairly: [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver) had not claimed that the Aramaic of [Daniel](bk.#Daniel) “proved” the book to be a product of the second century B.C.; he had said only that the Aramaic “permitted” it to be from that date.
[H. H. Rowley](bio.hhrowley_1), feeling that [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s learned article required a fuller response than that offered by [Driver](bio.SamuelDriver), produced The Aramaic of the Old Testament, which was vicious at points in its assessment of [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1), accusing him of inaccuracy, blindness, and prejudice in handling his data. [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) spent his last summer studying [Rowley](bio.hhrowley_1)’s book, but the materials found after his death were insufficient to be pieced together into publishable form.
In a series of essays published in 1919 in the Princeton Theological Review [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) set forth the method that he followed during his years at Western and Princeton.
These essays were later revised and enlarged for his Scientific Investigation of the Old Testament (1926).
He called his method “scientific” to emphasize that he based his conclusions on the evidence of facts rather than on the status of some recognized authority.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) appealed to textual, grammatical, linguistic, and historical evidences as well as comparable texts from cognate languages and cultures.
He would apply the evidence in the same way that documents are admitted in our courts of law, that is, to demonstrate what is reasonable to accept, given the weight of the facts.
He was consumed with a deep desire to remove the subjective intrusions into Old Testament studies in order that the objective facts could be given their proper prominence.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s wide-ranging argument was most clearly expressed in a booklet entitled Is the Higher Criticism Scholarly?
(1922).
This forerunner of A Scientific Investigation of the Old Testament claims to present “clearly attested facts showing that the destructive ‘assured results of modern scholarship’ are indefensible.”
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) begins by asserting that “there is no good reason for doubting that the Biblical narrative is derived from written sources.”  
Evidence for this statement is that [Abraham](bk.#Abraham) came from Babylonia, where writing had been in use for hundreds of years before his time.
Since Egypt also had by [Abraham](bk.#Abraham)’s time been using writing for some two thousand years, it would not be unreasonable to think that the patriarch conducted his business there in writing as well.
It is also possible to prove that the Hebrew language was used in Palestine before the time of [Moses](bk.#Moses).
For example, embedded in the Amarna correspondence between the pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty in Egypt (fourteenth century B.C.) and various princes in Palestine and Syria are more than one hundred common Hebrew words and more than thirty Hebrew names for cities in Palestine and Syria.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) then proceeds to point out that “the general scheme of chronology and geography presented to us in the Hebrew records corresponds with what we can learn from other documents of the same period.”  
That is to say, the annals of various foreign nations accord with what the Bible presents as the framework of world history.
Equally noteworthy is that the scriptural transliterations of “twenty-four names of kings of Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, et al., contain 120 consonantal letters, of which all are found in the same order in the transcriptions of the kings themselves or in those of their contemporaries.”  
This is remarkable, judges [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1), when compared to the transliteration of foreign words in other documents from comparable periods.
The Bible’s success in this area is unequaled in the history of literature.
Wilson then turns to the critics’ argument that the intrusion of foreign words into the Bible disproves the traditional claims regarding date and authenticity.
Also particularly vulnerable are the fifteen hundred words that appear only once in the Old Testament, and possibly the three thousand words that occur no more than five times in the Hebrew text.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s rejoinder to those who used many of these words as evidence for late dating of the biblical documents is unswerving: “In each stage of the literature the foreign words in the documents are found to belong to the language of the peoples that the Scriptures and the records of the nations surrounding Israel unite in declaring to have influenced and affected the Israelites at that time.”  
As for those words that occur nowhere else in Scripture, it is pointless to find such a word in a much later extrabiblical document and then assign to that word’s biblical context an equally late date.
That a word occurs but once in Scripture demonstrates only the uniqueness of the author’s style, but nothing particular about the date of his writing.
Turning from the language of the Old Testament to its literature, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) notes that the text exhibits all of the literary forms observed in the cognate literatures.
The legal forms are of particular interest, since the critics claim that the law as it is presented in the Old Testament did not come from the Mosaic era, but clearly was written later.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) has some tough questions for these critics to face.
First, if the covenant code of 20–24 and the main part of Deuteronomy actually came from the period of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, why is the king mentioned only once, and that in a passage ( 17) that only anticipates the kingly office?
And why is Zion or Jerusalem, the capital of the Judean kingdom, never mentioned if these laws were written hundreds of years later as many scholars claim?
Furthermore, why is there no mention of the temple, but only of what the critical scholars consider a mythical tabernacle?
Finally, how did the so-called priestly code’s emphasis on the shedding of blood come about, given that the Babylonian religion, its alleged source, does not seem to have assigned any importance or usefulness to the concept of blood.
In fact, the vocabulary bearing on the ceremonial observances is entirely different from that of the Babylonian system, from which the priestly aspects of the Torah were supposedly borrowed.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) applies the same scrutiny to the critics’ claims about the books of Chronicles, Psalms, [Ezra](bk.#Ezra.1) and [Nehemiah](bk.#Nehemiah.2).
He concludes with the complaint that the critics “cut up the books and doctor the documents and change the text and wrest the meaning, to suit the perverted view of their own fancy.
They seem to think that they know better what the Scriptures ought to have been than the prophets and apostles and even the Lord himself!”
In sum, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) championed the conservative position on many of the crucial issues of the day: the completion of the Old Testament canon before the last of the prophets (fifth century b.c.); the historicity and Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch (even though it may have later been revised by inspired editors); the trustworthiness of the sources on which the earlier prophets depended ([Joshua](bk.#Joshua), Judges, [Samuel](bk.#Samuel), and Kings); the legitimacy of the titles in the Book of Psalms; the Solomonic authorship of Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, and most of Proverbs; the traditional dating of the prophetical books; a fifth-century (or earlier) dating for [Job](bk.#Job); and a completion date for [Esther](bk.#Esther.1), [Ezra](bk.#Ezra.1)-[Nehemiah](bk.#Nehemiah.2), and Chronicles no later than 400 b.c.

## The Last Years

On April 11, 1927, the Kittanning Presbytery passed the following resolutions on the occasion of [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s fiftieth anniversary in the ministry:
Resolved, First: That the Presbytery of Kittanning acknowledge with gratitude that kind Providence that established the parental home of [Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) within our bounds; that has smiled on him in the midst of varying scenes of his life of eminent scholarship, and has placed within his left hand length of days, and in his right, riches of learning and the manifold honors of our glorious Church.
Resolved, Second: That this Presbytery extend to [Robert Dick](bio.RobertWilson.1) our heartiest congratulations upon his fifty years of service to our beloved Church and upon his conspicuously successful achievements in the Department of the Old Testament Criticism.
Resolved, Third: That, since a large proportion of the members of this Presbytery have been students of [Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) at the Western and the Princeton Theological Seminaries, this Presbytery express its appreciation of Dr. [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s example, sympathy, efficiency, and comradeship.
Resolved, Fourth: That the Presbytery of Kittanning extend to Dr. [Robert Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) its grateful appreciation of his continuance as a member in this Presbytery, although his home, for the greater part of the year, and his work have been elsewhere, and we cherish the hope that many years of life and health and happiness may be in store for him and that often we may be honored with his presence and blessed by his gracious influence.
It was also noted in the same set of minutes that [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s service extended far beyond the classroom and his publications.
In the preceding five years he had delivered about five hundred lectures in defense of the Bible.
His itinerary had included Japan, Korea, China, England, Wales, Scotland, Canada, and many of the larger cities of the United States.
And in that very year he had also addressed the two opening sessions of the Ninth International Congress of the World’s Christian Fundamentals Association.
On May 23, 1929, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. met in St. Paul with the election of a new moderator the most controversial item on the agenda.
The two men who had considerable backing were [Cleland McAfee](bio.clelandboydmcafee_1), a professor of systematic theology at McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago, and [Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1).
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s candidacy was sponsored by a group of “fundamentalists” who yearned for the Old School Presbyterianism that had prevailed prior to its reunion with the New School in 1870.
The Old School advocates also objected to the policies of J. Ross Stevenson, Princeton Seminary’s president, who desired to place the management of the school under a single board instead of two bodies, a board of directors and a board of trustees.
Despite being in his seventy-fourth year, with an honorable retirement awaiting him in a comfortable home, [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) chose to leave Princeton Seminary after its reorganization to help [J. Gresham Machen](bio.JohnMachen) and [Oswald T. Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) start Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia.
[Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) had been at Princeton nearly thirty years.
On Saturday, October 11, 1930, [Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1), professor of Semitic philology and Old Testament criticism at Westminster Theological Seminary, entered into his heavenly reward.
His last public appearance was on October 1, 1930, at the opening exercises of the second year of Westminster Theological Seminary.
Two weeks later his body was laid to rest in the cemetery in Indiana, Pennsylvania.
It happened that the Board of Trustees of Princeton Seminary was meeting on Tuesday, October 14, 1930, the very day of [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s funeral.
In the minutes was recorded the following: “The hour of four o’clock having arrived, and having been informed that at this hour the funeral services of the Rev. [Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1), D.D., were being held in Philadelphia, Pa., the Board of Trustees suspended its regular order of business to stand in solemn tribute to him who had served the Seminary so long and faithfully as a teacher.
The President, Dr. [McEwan](bio.wlmcewan_1), led the Board of Trustees in prayer.”
The board included in the minutes a unanimous motion “to express to [[Robert Dick](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s] family the sincere sympathy of its members, and to express its appreciation of the long and faithful service he rendered the Seminary and the whole Church in a most distinguished way.”

# [Geerhardus Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)/[James T. Dennison, Jr.](bio.jamestdennisonjr_1)

The so-called father of Reformed biblical theology, [Geerhardus Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) was born in Heerenveen, Friesland, the Netherlands, on March 14, 1862.
His father, [Jan Hendrik Vos](bio.janhendrikvos_1) (1826–1913), was trained at Kampen and pastored six churches of the Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk before emigrating to the United States.
Educated at the gymnasium at Schiedam and then at Amsterdam, [Geerhardus](bio.geerhardusvos) graduated with honors in 1881.
His nineteen-year-old world changed abruptly when his father, eager to quit Europe and the rise of German nationalism, sought a call to the New World.
Following a trail pioneered by Dutch immigrants, [Jan Vos](bio.janhendrikvos_1) accepted the pastorate of the Spring Street Christian Reformed Church (now the First Christian Reformed Church) of Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[Geerhardus](bio.geerhardusvos) enrolled in the Theologische School (now Calvin Theological Seminary) and for the next two years devoted himself to theological studies.
When he completed the requirements in 1883, he bypassed an appointment as assistant docent at his Grand Rapids alma mater in order to enrol at the bastion of Old School Reformed orthodoxy, Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey.
At Princeton, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) sat at the feet of two sons of the celebrated [Charles Hodge](bio.CharlesHodge): [Archibald Alexander](bio.ArchibaldHodge) (systematic theology) and [Caspar Wistar](bio.casparwistarhodge_1) (New Testament).
[Francis Landey Patton](bio.francislandeypatton) (apologetics and ethics) and [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s esteemed Old Testament mentor, [William Henry Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen), were also members of the faculty.
For [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen), [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) wrote The Mosaic Origin of the Pentateuchal Codes as part of the competition for a Hebrew fellowship.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) won that competition and applied the fellowship to study abroad, first in Berlin, then in Strasbourg.
From October 1885 to August 1886, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) took postgraduate courses at the University of Berlin.
He was both challenged and stimulated by the lectures of [Christian Friedrich August Dillmann](bio.augustdillmann) (“Old Testament Introduction,” “Exilic Passages of the Book of Isaiah”), [Carl Philipp Bernhard Weiss](bio.bernhardweiss) (“The Epistle to the Galatians”), and [Hermann Strack](bio.HermannStrack) (“The Book of Proverbs”).
It was during the spring of 1886 that [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) made his first known contact with [Abraham Kuyper](bio.AbrahamKuyper), founder of the Free University of Amsterdam.
[Kuyper](bio.AbrahamKuyper) urged [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) to consider an appointment as professor of Old Testament theology.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos), however, could not disappoint his parents in Grand Rapids by remaining in the homeland.
Perhaps to further incline him to return to America, in the summer of 1886 the Synod of the Christian Reformed Church (Hollandsche Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk in Amerika) appointed him professor of theology at the Theologische School.
Ostensibly to build a bridge to the emerging English-speaking Dutch community, the trustees of the Theologische School specified that [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) deliver his lectures in English and preach weekly in English in the churches of Grand Rapids and its environs.
Seemingly undaunted by these inordinate demands, the dutiful son accepted the appointment, although his “sorrow” at declining the invitation to the Free University was plainly stated in personal correspondence with [Kuyper](bio.AbrahamKuyper) and [Herman Bavinck](bio.HermanBavinck).
This same correspondence indicates that [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) was already under considerable strain.
His health broke on at least two occasions, necessitating curtailment of his doctoral program on orders from his physicians.
The synod in North America indulged these delays, patiently postponing his appointment and inauguration.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) moved from Berlin to Strasbourg in the fall of 1886 in order to complete his Ph.D. studies (Oct. 1886–April 1888).
The move was apparently motivated by [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s desire to be involved with a smaller, more intimate faculty.
Here [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) encountered the liberal [Heinrich Julius Holtzmann](bio.HeinrichHoltzmann) (New Testament), [Wilhelm Gustav Hermann Nowack](bio.wilhelmnowack_1) (Old Testament), [Wilhelm Windelband](bio.wilhelmwindelband) (philosophy), and [Theodor Nöldeke](bio.theodornoldeke) (Oriental languages).
It was [Nöldeke](bio.theodornoldeke) who supervised his dissertation.
This rather uninspiring work (“Die Kämpfe und Streitigkeiten zwischen den Banū ’Umajja und den Banū Hāšim ”)
amounted to a textual collation of an Arabic manuscript by [Tagi-al-Din Ahmad Maqrizi](bio.tagialdinahmadmaqrizi_1) (1364–1442) that describes the conflict between the Umayyads and the Hashimites.
Doctoral degree in hand, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) returned at age twenty-six to Grand Rapids, where he took up his duties as professor of didactic and exegetical theology at the Theologische School.
On September 4, 1888, he delivered his inaugural address, “De uitzichten der theologie in Amerika” (The prospects of theology in America), which, characteristically, had a future orientation.
For the next five years, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) taught philosophy, dogmatics, systematics, and non-Christian religions (Idololatrie) up to twenty-five hours a week.
He wrote several of his own textbooks: a five-volume Dogmatiek (later published in three volumes), a Systematische theologie, and Geschiedenis der idololatrie.
In 1890, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s contacts with [Abraham Kuyper](bio.AbrahamKuyper) resumed.
[Kuyper](bio.AbrahamKuyper) was seeking an English translator for his Encyclopaedie der heilige godgeleerdheid (Encyclopedia of sacred theology).
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s facility in both tongues had caught the attention of the future prime minister.
During this exchange of letters [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) indicated his alarm that the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. was moving toward revision of the Westminster Confession of Faith.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s high Calvinism balked at this veiled attempt to substitute Arminianism for the Reformed doctrine of double predestination.
Credal revision was an expression of the downgrade of historic Calvinism, and [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) feared its insidious penetration into Dutch Reformed circles.
Modification of the doctrine of election and reprobation inevitably reflected a modified view of the covenant of grace.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) met this challenge head-on in his rectoral address of 1891 “De verbondsleer in de gereformeerde theologie” (The doctrine of the covenant in Reformed theology).
But this brilliant address was not sufficient to quell the controversy swirling around [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s own views of the ordo salutis.
Evidently a moderate supralapsarian, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) ran afoul of a vigorous group of infralapsarians in the Grand Rapids classis.
He even wrote to [Kuyper](bio.AbrahamKuyper) for his views on the matter in an attempt to justify his position in the face of the infralapsarianism of the Canons of Dort.
By the summer of 1891, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) was clearly unhappy with his position in Grand Rapids.
To earlier inquiries from Princeton Theological Seminary he had pleaded parental loyalties and theological ties to the Dutch rather than the American Presbyterian tradition.
But the workload, the poorly educated students, the carping criticisms (“useless bickering” [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) called it), the parochial Dutch community all made his old friend and mentor’s persistent invitations very attractive.
In the spring of 1892, [William Henry Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) urged [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) to weigh an offer to teach at Princeton as “the turning point of your life.”
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) was cognizant of the mode of the times.
Traditional conservative positions with respect to the inspiration, authenticity, and historicity of the Bible were being undermined by a new phenomenon critical biblical theology.
In 1892 the Presbytery of New York tried [Charles Augustus Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs) on a charge of heresy.
The underlying issue was the role of biblical theology in the theological encyclopedia.
For [Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs), biblical theology determined all, for it was the theology in tune with the times.
Briggs marked the acme of the liberal, higher-critical assault on the inspiration, inerrancy, and historicity of the Word of [God](bk.#God).
[Briggs](bio.CharlesBriggs) had popularized a new tool in this battle for the Bible.
In his hands and the hands of his higher-critical allies, biblical theology married post-Enlightenment philosophy (“scientific theology”) with history (actually, history reconstructed via Enlightenment reductionism).
The result was a desupernaturalizing of the Scriptures in the interest of progressive, philosophically determined historicism.
This emerging liberalism was sweeping virtually every theological faculty it had already captured Germany, Scotland, and England.
Green realized that if Old Princeton was going to provide an informed answer to critical biblical theology, an advocate with firsthand knowledge of the critical sources would have to be recruited.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) was the prime candidate (Green described him as the “one competent engineer … who is summoned to check the dangerous influx of devastating … rationalism in theology and criticism”).
[Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) officially offered him the newly conceived chair of biblical theology at Princeton.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) declined.
But [Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) persisted, playing [Farel](bio.WilliamFarel) to [Calvin](bio.JohnCalvin), and in September 1893 [Geerhardus Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) took up residence in Hodge Hall as the [Charles T. Haley](bio.charlesthaley_1) Professor of Biblical Theology.
Grand Rapids complained and lamented, but [Kuyper](bio.AbrahamKuyper) said that [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) had saved himself from academic suicide by heading east.
Ironically, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s successor in Grand Rapids was [Henricus Beuker](bio.henricusbeuker_1), a brother of [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s mother, [Aaltje Beuker Vos](bio.aaltjebeukervos_1).
For the next thirty-nine years, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) would labor in the halls of Old School orthodoxy.
Among his colleagues were [Benjamin Breckenridge Warfield](bio.BenjaminWarfield), [J. Gresham Machen](bio.JohnMachen), [Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1), [William Park Armstrong](bio.williamparkarmstrong_1), [William Brenton Greene, Jr.](bio.williambrentongreenejr_1), [James Oscar Boyd](bio.jamesoscarboyd_1), and [Oswald Thompson Allis](bio.OswaldAllis).
He received ordination as an evangelist from the Presbytery of New Brunswick (Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.) on April 24, 1894, at the Second Presbyterian Church of Princeton.
On May 8 he delivered his inaugural address (“The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline”) to a full audience at the First Presbyterian Church.
On September 7 he married [Catherine Frances Smith](bio.catherinefrancessmith_1) of Grand Rapids.
They were to be the parents of four children: [Johannes G.](bio.johannesgvos_1) (b. 1903), [Bernhardus](bio.bernhardusvos_1) (b. 1905), [Marianne](bio.mariannevos_1) (Mrs. [William Radius](bio.williamradius_1)) (b. 1906), and [Geerhardus, Jr.](bio.geerhardusvosjr_1) (b. 1911).
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s teaching load at Princeton included courses in Arabic, Syriac, Old Testament eschatology, Pauline eschatology, the theology of Hebrews, the prophets of the eighth century B.C., the Petrine discourses in Acts, the messianic consciousness of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus), and, of course, the staple, Old and New Testament biblical theology.
Each summer the [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) family left their home at 52 Mercer Street and traveled to Roaring Branch in central Pennsylvania.
Here, in a roomy yet quiet setting, the family read together, walked together, and worshiped together (in the lone Methodist church).
[Geerhardus](bio.geerhardusvos) studied, wrote, created articles, lectures, reviews, books, sermons, poems.
It was here, in this secluded mountain village, that [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) penetrated the Word of [God](bk.#God) as no other before him in the Reformed tradition.
Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments (1948), The Pauline Eschatology (1930), The Teaching of the Epistle to the Hebrews (1956), The Self-Disclosure of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus): The Modern Debate about the Messianic Consciousness (1926), Grace and Glory:
Sermons Preached in the Chapel of Princeton Theological Seminary (1922), Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation: The Shorter Writings of [Geerhardus Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) (1980) all testify to his unique insights which matured in those quiet summer days.
And it was in a hillside cemetery in this summer retreat that [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s body was laid to rest beside his wife.
Catherine (author of the Child’s Story Bible) had died on September 14, 1937, in Santa Ana, California, where the couple had retired at the close of the Princeton years.
[Geerhardus](bio.geerhardusvos) then returned to the place of his American beginning Grand Rapids and the home of his daughter, with whom he resided until his death on Saturday, August 13, 1949.
[Henry Meeter](bio.henrymeeter_1) of Calvin College conducted the funeral service in Grand Rapids on the following Monday.
On Wednesday, August 17, 1949, [Cornelius Van Til](bio.corneliusvantil) of Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia and [John DeWaard](bio.johndewaard_1) of the Memorial Orthodox Presbyterian Church in Rochester, New York, officiated at the interment in Roaring Branch.
But no one from Princeton or the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. was present.

## Unique Emphasis: The Inbreaking of the Eschatological

[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) formulated a distinctively evangelical and Reformed approach to biblical theology.
Positioning himself over against every form of liberal reductionism, he affirmed the supernatural character and integrity of the Word of [God](bk.#God).
This antithetical stance was not merely the affirmation of a son of the historical orthodox church against [Gotthold Lessing](bio.GottholdLessing)’s ugly ditch and [Immanuel Kant](bio.ImmanuelKant)’s epistemological divide.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s adherence to the objectivity of supernatural revelation was anchored in the objectivity of [God](bk.#God) himself.
The [God](bk.#God) who is has spoken in history.
That revelation is not mere witness (Zeugnis), not mere religious insight, not mere idealism or rationalism, not mere developmental comparison of Semitic and Hellenistic religions (Religionsgeschichte).
Rather, that revelation is the objective self-communication of the very words of [God](bk.#God) (ipsissima verba Dei) from his throne room, his arena, his heavenly domain, his very being.
In other words, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) eschatologizes revelation.
His biblical theology is theocentric because in his view revelation is the very word from the above to the below.
The arena in which [God](bk.#God) himself dwells is the arena from which he speaks.
And that speech is intended to reveal that eschatological arena to the listening creature.
Even before the fall, even before [Eve](bk.#Eve2.1), [Adam](bk.#Adam) was invited by [God](bk.#God) to come up a little higher to enter into the eschatological arena.
The earth was never intended to be the locus of man’s eschatological rest.
It was an arena of probation, protologically oriented to the eschatological heavens.
In his magnum opus Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) teaches us that eschatology is prior to soteriology, even as heaven is prior to [Adam](bk.#Adam)’s fall.
The implication of this observation profoundly alters one’s view of revelation in history.
The earth is temporal and temporary.
This world will pass away.
[God](bk.#God)’s dwelling place is permanent, eternal (in the heavens), never to fade away.
If the protological [Adam](bk.#Adam) failed, the eschatological [Adam](bk.#Adam) will not.
If the first [Adam](bk.#Adam) dissolved to his dusty origins, the second [Adam](bk.#Adam) will not see corruption, but is raised a life-giving spirit.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) taught his students (and continues to teach his readers) that to understand the Bible, one must begin with [God](bk.#God).
And to begin with [God](bk.#God) is to begin with the eschatological arena.
Every word from [God](bk.#God) is a summons to that heavenly arena.
In this postlapsarian world, the only ladder to that arena is the Son of man himself.
[Christ Jesus](bk.#Jesus), the man from heaven, covenantally binds himself to bring heaven down to earth in order that the sons and daughters of the earth may be brought to heaven.
The progress of the history of revelation is, for [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos), the outworking of this protological/eschatological pattern (“eschatology becomes the mother of theology and that first of all theology in the form of a philosophy of redemptive history”).
Using his favorite analogy, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) traces the unfolding history of redemption from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem in terms of a flower developing from bud to blossom.
Inherent in the earlier stages of the flower are the later.
Indeed, retrospectively and prospectively the flower, at every stage of growth, is organically related to history past, history present, and history future.
This linear or horizontal dimension in the development of the history of redemption has been called the typological.
But for [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos), typology is not enough.
The dynamic of a theocentric (and christocentric) revelation must recognize the vertical dimension.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) transforms traditional biblical study by introducing a hermeneutic with an intersecting plane: the vertical intrudes into the horizontal; the eternal penetrates the temporal; the protological and the eschatological intersect.
His diagram of the two-age construction of the New Testament Era (see figure 1) pictures the overarching “age to come” (above) interpenetrating this “present evil age” (below).
The church thus finds itself in a semieschatological tension between the now and the not yet.
Even while yearning for the consummation and the resurrection of the body (the not yet), the believer is now seated in heavenly places in [Christ Jesus](bk.#Jesus) ( 2:6).
The believer, “hidden with [Christ](bk.#Jesus) in [God](bk.#God)” ( 3:3 NIV), possesses even now the status of the sons and daughters of [God](bk.#God) as an indication of what is yet to come.
Figure 1
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s Added Dimension in Biblical Hermeneutics
(from The Pauline Eschatology, 38)
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) carefully delineated his method of biblical theology at the inauguration of his career at Princeton (his 1894 address).
This method was also evident in the final manuscript (as yet unpublished) to flow from his pen (Old Testament Eschatology).
In between, each essay, each sermon, each book, each review, each article explored the intersection of the eschatological with the temporal.
His rectoral address of 1891 (see p. 84)
positioned covenant as the subsidiary organizing principle of the history of redemption.
In Reformed doctrine covenant becomes an archetypal pattern for the disclosure of [God](bk.#God)’s words and deeds.
Revelation is primary, but occurs in history.
How can we maintain at once the transcendent unity and developmental diversity of that self-disclosure?
The relationship which binds creature and Creator throughout time and space, the relationship which draws the creature into union with the Creator, the relationship which breathes the mutuality of our being chosen and being grateful, is covenant: the covenant between the Father and the Son, the covenant of works between the Creator and his protological creation, the covenant of grace between the Creator and his eschatological (un)creation.
When the covenant reached its semieschatological climax at the inbreaking of the kingdom of heaven, the church became the heir to the fullness of the promises.
She is nothing less than the new Israel in which the sojourners (the “Hebrews”) at the end of the age live out their odyssey to the New Jerusalem, the heavenly Zion, the land of eschatological Sabbath rest.
The Pauline eschatology is but a species of this sublime drama conceived in the encounter with the risen [Christ](bk.#Christ) on the Damascus Road.
The Pharisee is transformed by the encounter with eschatological life.
Now [Saul](bk.#Paul), bondslave of the law of Judaism, must be the servant of the Messiah for the Gentiles.
Old is displaced with new the law does not justify; the blood of [Abraham](bk.#Abraham) does not save; the mysteries of the seers do not enlighten.
Only [Christ Jesus](bk.#Jesus) justifies as he himself has been justified by resurrection from the dead (1 **\_**3:16).
Only faith in [Christ](bk.#Christ) saves as he himself has been faithful up to and through death.
Only the mystery of [Christ](bk.#Christ) enlightens as he himself is the effulgence and radiance of the Father.
The eschatological lifestyle is dramatically rehearsed in the church which [Paul](bk.#Paul) planted.
In [Christ](bk.#Christ), the church has died to the law that she may be raised to reflect the moral character of heaven itself.
In [Christ](bk.#Christ), the church walks by faith because she even now possesses the reality of the heavenly arena.
In [Christ](bk.#Christ), the church sees the light of glory and reflects that radiance to a dark and dreary world.

## Four Revolutionary Volumes

Vos penned four revolutionary volumes after his appointment to the faculty of Princeton Seminary.
Each volume accents [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s unique emphasis on the priority of eschatology.
Their perspectives are, respectively, eschatology and the kingdom, eschatology and the homiletic moment, eschatology and the messianic self-consciousness of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus), and eschatology and the Pauline theology.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s first book-length contribution to the biblical theology of his day was The Teaching of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) concerning the Kingdom of [God](bk.#God) and the Church (1903).
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s exegesis contrasts the kingdom of [God](bk.#God) proclaimed by [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) with (1) first-century Jewish expectations; (2) nineteenth-century liberal views of the kingdom of [God](bk.#God) according to which [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) is not the bringer of the kingdom ([God](bk.#God) is!), but rather the one who prepares humans for the appearance of the kingdom (which he mistakenly expected in his own lifetime); and (3) the early-twentieth-century apocalyptic-eschatological view (e.g., of [Albert Schweitzer](bio.albertschweitzer)) that [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) attempted to extort the kingdom from [God](bk.#God) only to die in dereliction when [God](bk.#God) abandoned him.
The fundamental error of all three views is the desupernaturalizing of the kingdom.
For [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos), the coming of the kingdom which [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) announced entailed supernatural events both visible (e.g., the miracles) and hidden (e.g., the underlying referents of the parables).
This kingdom begins for us in regeneration (supernatural rebirth) and continues with gifts derived from the spiritual person and work of [Christ](bk.#Christ).
Our incorporation into this spiritual aspect of the kingdom is the ongoing function of the Spirit of [Christ](bk.#Jesus), who brought it with his very own advent.
And yet there is a not yet.
The kingdom which [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) announced has a future eschatological dimension.
It will be consummated in a sudden crisis so cosmic and visible in scope that the outcome will be utterly and totally final.
Supernatural incorporation into the kingdom now; supernatural consummation of the kingdom in the future.
The now and not yet (the two ages) of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ kingdom proclamation surpass Judaism with its nationalistic, political, sensual kingdom hopes.
The present and future aspects of the kingdom which [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) brings contravene classic liberalism, which immanentizes the eschaton.
And [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s presentation of [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s kingdom avoids the dereliction of [Schweitzer](bio.albertschweitzer)’s (non)historical [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) because it presumes the credibility and historicity of the Gospel records.
In 1922, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) published six sermons which he had delivered in the chapel of Princeton Theological Seminary.
These sermons represent the craft of the biblical theologian applied to the homiletical moment.
Each sermon highlights the priority of [God](bk.#God)’s invitation to his creature to dwell with him.
It is as if [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) reverses the traditional preaching event by drawing his listeners into the living text of Scripture rather than extracting truths from the text and imposing them upon the listeners.
Grace and Glory exemplifies a homiletical method encouraging and enabling [God](bk.#God)’s people to identify and unite with the life of [Christ](bk.#Christ) revealed in a particular word of [God](bk.#God).
In other words, the goal of preaching for [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) is not primarily application, nor is it fundamentally introspection it is supremely identification with and incorporation into [Christ](bk.#Christ).
The eschatological perspective dominates even the sermons [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) preached.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) published The Self-Disclosure of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus): The Modern Debate about the Messianic Consciousness in 1926.
In a scintillating survey of various views of [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s messianic self-consciousness, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) examines the evolution of the modern critical discussion from (1) denial of messianic consciousness in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) ([Gustav Volkmar](bio.gustavvolkmar_1), [James Martineau](bio.jamesmartineau_1), and [Nathaniel Schmidt](bio.nathanielschmidt)) to (2) an agnostic conclusion derived from [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ prohibition, especially in [Mark](bk.#Mark.1)’s Gospel, of the disciples’ revealing his messiahship ([William Wrede](bio.williamwrede)’s Messiasgeheimnis) to (3) the belief that [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) grew from not being conscious of being the Messiah to thinking he was the Messiah ([David Friedrich Strauss](bio.davidfriedrichstrauss), [Ernest Renan](bio.ernestrenan), and [Heinrich J. Holtzmann](bio.HeinrichHoltzmann)).
Always hovering in the background is the eschatological (actually noneschatological) [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) of [Albert Schweitzer](bio.albertschweitzer) and [Johannes Weiss](bio.JohannesWeiss).  
At heart, each liberal reduction is an attempt to eliminate the eschatological element from the person of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
In other words, desupernaturalize [Jesus of Nazareth](bk.#Jesus), and religion becomes “a movement taking its departure from [Christ](bk.#Jesus) and addressing itself to the world, rather than a movement seeking the Person of [Christ](bk.#Jesus) in order to occupy itself with him.
A religion intended to be first of all centripetal has become alarmingly centrifugal.”  
What [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) brilliantly points out is that to reduce [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) to the level of human religion, liberalism must make him part of the world, not distinct from the world.
But supernatural and eschatological messiahship sets him apart from the world (while yet in the world) as wholly unique.
All liberalism must re-create [Jesus of Nazareth](bk.#Jesus) in its own immanentistic image.
After surveying modern critical views, [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) spends the bulk of the volume in an exegetical tour de force with the messianic titles: [Christ](bk.#Jesus), the Lord, the Son of [God](bk.#God), the Son of man, Savior.
He concludes with an exposition of the messianic death, which, in itself, is not only exegetical of the prophetic projection (notably 53), but revelatory of the glory of the passion of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s legacy with regard to the messianic consciousness of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) is a rehabilitation of the orthodox supernatural view.
[Jesus of Nazareth](bk.#Jesus) is the Messiah because he is the supernatural Son of [God](bk.#God) anointed to be the Savior of his people.
To patronize [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) as a moral example while one rejects his supernatural person is pathological.
The final volume from the Princeton years was The Pauline Eschatology (1930).
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) has his eye primarily on the critical reduction of eschatology and [Paul](bk.#Paul), but he casts a glance at burgeoning premillennialism (chiliasm) and its competitor (postmillennialism).
The lengthy first chapter on the structure of the Pauline eschatology repristinates a Vosian emphasis “to unfold the Apostle’s eschatology means to set forth his theology as a whole.”  
It is the end (of history) that shapes the beginning of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s estimate of [Christ](bk.#Jesus).
In particular, as [Richard B. Gaffin, Jr.](bio.richardbgaffinjr), has demonstrated, the resurrection of the dead is the central motif of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s system.
With the resurrection of [Christ](bk.#Jesus), the future eon has burst in upon the present (see figure 1 on p. 87).
Believing Christians are even now in possession of the eschatological arena because they too have been raised up together with [Christ](bk.#Jesus).
Their life in this world is dominated by the age to come; their walk reflects the character of heaven’s Lord.
The Pauline church is conscious of living in the heavenlies even now as she sojourns towards the consummation.
In soteriology [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) demonstrates that for [Paul](bk.#Paul) and his churches the ultimate is determinative of the present, not vice versa.
Likewise, eschatology is prior to and determinative of ethics.
All moralism, whether liberal or conservative, is unbiblical because it is fundamentally anthropocentrism religiously conditioned.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s contribution to the centennial celebration of Princeton Seminary in 1912 (“The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit”) should be integrated at this point, for it forms the backbone of chapter 6 of The Pauline Eschatology.
The function of the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) after the glorification of the risen Lord [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) is to incorporate the believer now into the life of the age to come.
The down payment (arrabōn ) of the life of heaven is displayed in the life of the believer.
This is so because the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) unites Christians to their ascended Lord and energizes their existence in the world.
[Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s sermons, essays, books, and poems were a constant litany of the difference [Christ](bk.#Jesus) makes.
That difference is anticipated in the eschatological intrusion evident in the biblical theology of the Old Testament.
That christocentric difference is inaugurally semirealized in the eschatological intrusion evident in the biblical theology of the New Testament.
That difference will be fully realized in face-to-face consummation at the death of the believer and the second advent of the Son of glory.
This litany has been a legacy precious to many.
Most notably [John Murray](bio.JohnMurray), [Cornelius Van Til](bio.corneliusvantil), and [Ned Stonehouse](bio.nedstonehouse) of Westminster Theological Seminary embraced [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s biblical theology and attempted to articulate it in the classroom, pulpit, and publications.
[Richard B. Gaffin, Jr](bio.richardbgaffinjr)., [Herman Ridderbos](bio.HermanNicolaasRidderbos), [Meredith G. Kline](bio.meredithgkline_1), and [James](bio.jamestdennison), Charles, and [William Dennison](bio.williamdennison_1) have attempted further extensions of [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s original insights.
In 1986 Kerux: A Journal of Biblical-Theological Preaching was launched to nurture the contemporary expression of [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s biblical theology.
Each proponent has realized that the practice of biblical theology in [Vos](bio.geerhardusvos)’s sense draws the believer into union with the [Christ](bk.#Jesus) of Scripture as he is displayed from heaven from Genesis to Revelation.
And life in [Christ](bk.#Jesus) is of course the most practical form of Christianity for the New Testament church.
[Geerhardus Vos](bio.geerhardusvos) has provided us with the key for this preeminently biblical lifestyle.

A consequence of his forty-six years of teaching at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary was that his influence was particularly strong among Southern Baptists.

## Background

[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was born on November 6, 1863, two years before the Civil War in America ended.
For the first twelve years of his life he lived at the family home near Chatham, Virginia.
These twelve years saw the defeat of the Confederacy, the loss of the family’s large number of slaves, and eventually his father’s bankruptcy.
In September of 1875, with the two oldest boys left behind to harvest the corn and tobacco, the [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) family moved to Statesville, North Carolina, where [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) lived until November of 1879 when he left for Wake Forest College.
After almost six years at Wake Forest (the lack of a full high school course made this necessary)
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) graduated in the spring of 1885.
He then went to Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, completing his student work in the spring of 1888, but remaining as a member of the faculty until his death in September of 1934.
The greatest influence on [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was [John A. Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus), a member of the original faculty and professor of New Testament interpretation and homiletics.
[Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) had graduated from the University of Virginia, where he had studied Greek under [Gessner Harrison](bio.gessnerharrison_1).
[Harrison](bio.gessnerharrison_1) emphasized the historical method of language study that was being developed in Germany.
A novelty then but increasingly accepted, this method was passed on by [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) and adopted by [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson).
Also evident in [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s career is the influence of [Basil Manly, Jr.](bio.basilmanlyjr), the most conservative of the four original faculty members of the seminary.
Manly’s courses in Old Testament interpretation and biblical introduction helped [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) to formulate the critical framework in which he was to study, teach, and write.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) is usually and correctly thought of as the successor to [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus), but before he succeeded [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) in New Testament interpretation, he had succeeded [Manly](bio.basilmanlyjr) in biblical introduction.

## The Period of Beginnings (1888–94)

In the spring of 1888 [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was engaged by the seminary to work alongside [John R. Sampey](bio.johnrsampey_1) in correcting papers and carrying out various other duties in the areas of Hebrew, Greek, and homiletics.
[Sampey](bio.johnrsampey_1), who became well known in Old Testament studies, acknowledged that [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was the more competent in Greek.
Accordingly, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) went into New Testament interpretation and [Sampey](bio.johnrsampey_1) into Old Testament interpretation.
For two years [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) served as assistant to [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) and did research in the New Testament.
Then in May of 1890 he was made an assistant professor of Greek and homiletics.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) made rapid strides in those early years.
In the summer of 1890 a trip to Europe enabled him to study the German language and hear lectures by leading German scholars.
He was asked to take part in the Baptist Congress of 1892 held in Philadelphia.
And in May of 1892, after [Manly](bio.basilmanlyjr)’s death, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was appointed professor of biblical introduction and promoted to associate professor of New Testament interpretation.
Immediately upon his appointment to the faculty [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) began his long writing career.
He contributed articles to the Seminary Magazine and to various Baptist state papers in the North and South.
Four particularly controversial subjects appeared and reappeared in the Baptist state papers: the nature of the Bible and its inspiration, the role of women in the church, the nature of the church in the New Testament, and the [Whitsitt](bio.williamhwhitsitt_1) dispute.
The editors encouraged running debates between [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) and various individuals who disagreed with him.
These occasional articles “he dashed … off with amazing rapidity and skill.
Not a few of these were produced on whatever paper he might have at hand while at stations between trains, at intervals between engagements where he might be lecturing or preaching.”

## The Period of Concentration on Greek Grammar (1895–1914)

In March of 1895 [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) died, and two months later [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was asked to succeed his colleague as professor of New Testament interpretation.
The [Whitsitt](bio.williamhethwhitsitt_1) controversy immediately caught up the new professor.
[W. H. Whitsitt](bio.williamhethwhitsitt_1), president and professor of church history at Southern, had written that [Roger Williams](bio.RogerWilliams) had probably been sprinkled rather than immersed, and that among English Baptists the immersion of believers was begun by [Edward Barber](bio.edwardbarber_1) in 1641.
Southern Baptist reactions were seen in the denominational press and at various association meetings and state conventions.
Sides were taken, and from 1896 to 1899 the battle raged.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) and [Sampey](bio.johnrsampey_1) were among [Whitsitt](bio.williamhwhitsitt_1)’s most loyal supporters; and after [Sampey](bio.johnrsampey_1) left on a trip to Europe and Palestine, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) became the leader of the Kentucky group defending [Whitsitt](bio.williamhethwhitsitt_1).
Insofar as the teaching at Southern Seminary was concerned, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) continued the undergraduate courses of study much as [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) had organized them.
But in postgraduate work which had been instituted in 1892 when the board of trustees set up new curricula including a Th.D. program requiring at least five special courses and the preparation of a thesis [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) made some changes.
He gradually dropped all of the required special courses except Greek exegesis, the area in which he and all his advanced students now began to major.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s method of teaching developed naturally within the framework provided by his teachers and colleagues at the seminary.
He would begin class with prayer and then quickly move to questioning the students on the lesson for the day.
The questions called for specific facts, not opinions or interpretations.
This questioning would sometimes continue for the majority of the class period.
The recitation method was a fearful thing in the hands of [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson).
Grades were recorded for the answers given, and sharp statements to the student were frequent.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) became known as the faculty member to whom was delegated the task of puncturing students’ conceit.  
The advanced classes were handled quite differently, however.
Although [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was characterized as a “near tyrant” in his courses in the English New Testament, he was a “friendly teacher” in senior Greek and a “genial comrade in scholarship” in his seminars.
The real beginning of [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s career as an author of books came in 1901 when his Life and Letters of [John Albert Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was published.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) wrote the book in longhand
and then, as his custom continued to be, had a seminary student type it in a form acceptable to the publisher.
The vast majority of [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s energy during this period was spent in the field of Greek grammar.
In 1898 he began a series of articles on Greek syntax for the Seminary Magazine.
By 1900 these articles had grown into a little book of ninety-nine pages entitled New Testament Greek Syllabus for Junior Greek Class.
Its series of lessons in syntax reflected the historical method that [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) had championed.
Soon [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) began the gigantic task of writing the Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light of Historical Research, which was to be his chief task for twelve years.
While this work was progressing, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) wrote his Short Grammar of the Greek New Testament to replace his Greek Syllabus.
By 1931, when The Short Grammar was completely rewritten, there had been eight English editions and translations into Italian, French, German, and Dutch.
The volume popularly called the “Big Grammar” was finally published on June 12, 1914, and met with immediate success in the scholarly world.
In the following nine years it was to go through four editions and grow from 1,360 to 1,454 pages.
Although the majority of [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s interest and energy was spent on Greek grammar during this period, he found time to write nine other books in different fields.
In 1902 he published a Syllabus for New Testament Study, which was designed to be used in his course in the English New Testament.
By the time of the fifth edition (1923) the syllabus had expanded from 129 to 274 pages and was used by a variety of institutions.
It was even brought out by a British publisher.
In 1904 came The Teaching of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) concerning [God](bk.#God) the Father, which was written for the Teaching of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) series published by the American Tract Society.
Having seen a need for a volume that would present the New Testament books in general chronological order along with an introductory sketch for each book, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) published The Student’s Chronological New Testament in the same year.
Several books grew out of popular lectures.
Keywords in the Teaching of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) resulted from lectures in June 1904 to the Jackson Springs (N.C.) Summer Assembly.
Epochs in the Life of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) (1907) grew out of 1906 lectures on the career of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) to an assembly at Pertle Springs, Missouri.
The response to this book was so favorable that [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) wrote a companion volume on [Paul](bk.#Paul) which was published in 1909 as Epochs in the Life of [Paul](bk.#Paul).
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) considered this his best volume after his “Big Grammar.”
In 1911 [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) published three books.
The Gospel according to [Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1) was one of a series of commentaries written under the editorship of [Shailer Mathews](bio.ShailerMathews) and designed for popular consumption.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) supported the two-source theory of Gospel relationships.
[John](bk.#JohntheBaptist) the Loyal was a study of the ministry of [John the Baptist](bk.#JohntheBaptist).
The Glory of the Ministry was a series of lectures on [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s concept of ministry.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s reputation as a New Testament scholar grew to such an extent in this period that he was requested to assist in the writing of several Bible reference books, including The Cross-Reference Bible and The 1911 Bible, which commemorated the original publication of the Authorized Version three hundred years earlier.
He also continued to contribute articles to popular and professional journals (Baptist Argus, Watchman-Examiner, Sunday School Times, Bible Student, Bible Student and Teacher, Record of Christian Work, Review and Expositor, Presbyterian and Reformed Review, Biblical World, and Homiletical Review).

## The Period of Diverse Production (1915–34)

Very early in his career [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) had organized his courses in New Testament so well that in his later years he needed little time to prepare for them.
Instead, he spent a great deal of time in preparing and delivering popular lectures, for various religious groups coveted him as a speaker.
Perhaps the Northfield (Mass.) and Winona Lake (Ind.) assemblies were those to which he most appealed and those that most appealed to him.
In the summer of 1912 [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) began a practice at Northfield which he was to follow regularly.
With Greek text in hand, he taught the Bible to large groups.
This proved so successful that twelve of the next twenty-one summers found him teaching at Northfield directly from the Greek text of the New Testament.
Some of his other lectures proved just as successful.
Between 1917 and 1929, for example, he delivered a series entitled “The Sermon on the Mount and Modern Life” thirty-one times.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was also in demand as a speaker at colleges and seminaries.
Twice he was invited to deliver the Stone Lectures at Princeton.
In February 1915 he delivered his first series, “The Pharisees and [Jesus](bk.#Jesus),” and in November 1926 his second series, “[Paul](bk.#Paul) and the Intellectuals.”
The majority of [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s labors during the period of diverse production, however, was spent in writing.
After the great work of 1914, his literary contribution in the field of New Testament Greek did not cease, although it took forms other than volumes on Greek grammar.
While continuing to revise and put out new editions of his grammars, he published some works in the area of textual criticism of the New Testament, translated the Gospel of [Luke](bk.#Luke.1), and began a translation of the entire New Testament.
He also produced a sort of commentary on the whole New Testament in his Word Pictures.
But [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s work in Greek during this period was minor compared to his work in other fields.
From 1914 to his death in 1934 there were only two years in which he failed to publish; in eleven of those years he published two or more books.
Of the thirty-three books produced, twenty-two are in areas other than Greek although [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s knowledge of Greek is evident throughout.
In 1915 two books appeared.
One of them, Practical and Social Aspects of Christianity, was basically a running commentary on the Epistle of [James](bk.#James).
It was republished several years later as Studies in the Epistle of [James](bk.#James), a title that the publisher thought would increase the sales.
The other book, Studies in the New Testament, was a teacher-training manual requested by the Southern Baptist Sunday School Board.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) published one book during each of the next three years.
The Divinity of [Christ](bk.#Christ) in the Gospel of [John](bk.#John), five lectures delivered before a group of Sunday school teachers in Atlanta, was published in 1916.
A series of expository talks on Philippians was published in 1917 under the title [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s Joy in [Christ](bk.#Jesus).
In 1918 appeared a book on [John Mark](bk.#Mark.1), Making Good in the Ministry.
Two of [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s books were published in 1919.
One dealt with the Gospel of [Mark](bk.#Mark.1) and the other with the general subject of Christian citizenship.
Studies in [Mark](bk.#Mark.1)’s Gospel was composed of various articles which had originally been published in scholarly journals.
The New Citizenship grew out of a month’s lectures at the Y.M.C.A. Army Camp at Blue Ridge, North Carolina.
During 1920 two more series of [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s lectures were put into book form.
The 1915 Stone Lectures at Princeton became The Pharisees and [Jesus](bk.#Jesus), and a series at Northfield became Luke the Historian in the Light of Research.
Paul the Interpreter of Christ, the sole book published by [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) in 1921, contained his opening lecture at Southern Seminary in 1911 (“[Paul](bk.#Paul) as an Interpreter of [Christ](bk.#Jesus)”) and various articles previously contributed to journals.
In 1922 [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) again offered two new books to the public.
A Harmony of the Gospels for Students of the Life of [Christ](bk.#Jesus) was a reworking of [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus)’s Harmony.
Types of Preachers in the New Testament was composed of articles that had appeared in various scholarly journals.
In the year of his sixtieth birthday, 1923, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) published two books: The Minister and His Greek New Testament and A Translation of [Luke](bk.#Luke.1)’s Gospel.
The following year also saw two new books.
New Testament History:
Airplane View was prepared as a student textbook for the Keystone Series of the International Graded Lessons system of the American Baptist Publication Society.
The [Christ](bk.#Jesus) of the Logia was composed mainly of articles previously written for various journals.
The year 1925 was the fourth straight year in which two books by [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) appeared: Introduction to Textual Criticism and a short book entitled The Mother of [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
After Studies in the Text of the New Testament in 1926, a year passed before [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) published again.
But in 1928 two books came out.
A running commentary on the Epistle to the Colossians, [Paul](bk.#Paul) and the Intellectuals had been delivered as the Stone Lectures in 1926.
Some Minor Characters in the New Testament was another collection of articles previously published in religious journals.
After another yearlong pause [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) offered three volumes of his Word Pictures to the public in 1930 and an additional volume in each of the following three years.
In 1931 [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) and [W. Hersey Davis](bio.williamherseydavis), his younger colleague in New Testament interpretation, produced A New Short Grammar of the Greek Testament.
In 1933 came Epochs in the Life of [Simon Peter](bk.#Peter); in 1934, Passing On the Torch; and in 1935 (the year after his death), Epochs in the Life of the Apostle [John](bk.#John).
During this period of diverse productivity [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) was called on to contribute to various volumes that promoted general understanding of the Bible.
Among these volumes were the Dictionary of the Apostolic Church, System Bible Study, Master Bible, Standard Bible Dictionary, and Abingdon Bible Commentary.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) also contributed essays to two volumes that honored fellow New Testament scholars.
For the Festgabe für Adolf Deissmann, published in 1927, he wrote “New Testament Grammar after Thirty Years.”
For Studies in Early Christianity, which honored [Frank Chamberlin Porter](bio.frankchamberlinporter) and [Benjamin Wisner Bacon](bio.benjaminwisnerbacon), he wrote “The Causal Use of” INA.”
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s activities as correspondent from Kentucky for the Watchman-Examiner, a role he had undertaken in 1895, continued into this period.
He also wrote for nearly all the Baptist state papers in the South; at least 119 of his articles appeared in the Christian Index.
In addition, scholarly essays by [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) appeared in such journals as Homiletic Review, Expositor, Review and Expositor, Expositor and Current Anecdotes, Biblical Review, Methodist Quarterly Review, and Expository Times.

## A Conservative Stance on the Nature and Interpretation of the New Testament

A continuing concern throughout [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s career was the nature of the Bible.
During his early teaching years as professor of biblical introduction he expressed in numerous articles views in accord with the position of [Manly](bio.basilmanlyjr).
Later he turned to other matters, but his basic ideas about the nature of the Bible never changed.
Because of inspiration the Bible is the divinely authoritative Word of [God](bk.#God).
“I am sure,” he affirmed, “that the New Testament will retain its hold on men because of the power in it, rather than because of any theory of inspiration.
The theories have come after the fact.
The hold will stay in spite of all the theories.
[God](bk.#God) is in the New Testament books whether we can tell how or not.”
Maintaining a critical stance, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) introduced his readers to detailed questions and arguments concerning authorship and authenticity.
But he always ended up on the conventional conservative side, for he saw beyond these questions to the basic message and purpose of the New Testament.
“That purpose is to put the soul in touch with [God](bk.#God) through [Christ](bk.#Christ).”  
The Bible is a presentation of truth concerning [Christ](bk.#Jesus) which purposes “to regenerate the heart, to make a new man out of the old man, to save him, soul and body.”
It reveals “truths that determine life and character and the eternal destiny of the soul.”
It is, chiefly, “a plan of rescue for the soul.”
Because he saw the evangelical purpose in the Bible as primary, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) became through the years more concerned with interpreting the Bible than with defending it as infallible and inerrant.
And yet he remained convinced of its infallibility.
This conviction was well expressed in a paper delivered at the Baptist Congress in Philadelphia in 1892.
He declared that the Bible is the Word of [God](bk.#God) because here [God](bk.#God) speaks as nowhere else.
[God](bk.#God) does not speak with infallible authority in the conscience of human beings, Christian experience, the church, or human reason.
[God](bk.#God) speaks with infallible authority only in the Bible.
It is, then, the sole authority in the realm in which it speaks.
This is true because “Scripture speaks in a realm which is above that of reason; Scripture speaks where reason could never have spoken.”  
Not that Scripture and reason are inconsistent, but that humans have been given a supernatural revelation above reason; therefore, when the Bible speaks on a subject, it is the end of the matter, for reason cannot go higher.
Humans are to exercise their reason in this realm only by coming to the Word and listening.
“It is the noblest exercise of the human intellect to sit at the feet of the Nazarene and learn of him what human hearts most need to know and can learn nowhere else.”  
Thirty years later [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) made a similar affirmation about the authority of the Bible:
I must think of the authority of the Bible as being the authority of [God](bk.#God)… .
The essential problem about the Bible is not[, then,] whether this detail of history has been established by research or whether this allusion in popular language to matters in nature is in harmony with modern scientific theory… .
That is quite beside the problem of the Bible.
The authority relates to [God](bk.#God)’s revelation of himself to men and to man’s relation to [God](bk.#God).

## Contribution to the Study of Greek Grammar

As we have seen, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) is most noted for his work in Greek grammar.
Almost everything he wrote reflects his knowledge of Greek.
The recent discovery of new resources for the study of the Greek New Testament along with the development of new methods of grammatical study caused [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) to recognize early in his career the need for a complete rewriting of the grammar of New Testament Greek.
And yet a number of years before he became aware of the new discoveries, he was already in the process of mastering what would prove to be one of the most important foundations of his achievements in the field of grammar.
This was the old Greek writings which he read at Wake Forest.
He declared, “I could not have carried on my studies in New Testament Greek on the scale undertaken without the broad and secure foundation in the Old Greek writers.”  
He used the works of classical authors repeatedly throughout his writings on Greek grammar.
As we would expect, he used the writings of the Koine period more frequently.
He included in this group all of the writers from the Greek poets of the third century B.C. through the Christian writers of the early Christian centuries.
He also made wide use of various Jewish writings.
Especially prominent was his use of the Septuagint, which he saw as an example of Koine and, therefore, as having affinities with the Greek of the New Testament at many points.
The New Testament itself, of course, was the basic source of [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s study.
While remaining in touch with the important points in the general history of the Greek language, he always attempted to “keep the Greek of the N.T. out in the middle.”
The new resources which demanded a “new grammar on a new plan” were discoveries in the areas of comparative philology and the study of the papyri.
Then too there was the historical method of grammatical study, which was based on comparative philology.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) adopted this method from [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) before the turn of the century and stated that “historical grammar is the only sensible grammar.”  
He saw Sir [William Jones](bio.williamjones)’s study of Sanskrit as revolutionizing grammatical research.
[Franz Bopp](bio.franzbopp_1) had used the knowledge of Sanskrit to found comparative philology, but [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) found most useful the work of [Karl Brugmann](bio.karlbrugmann_1) and [B. Delbrück](bio.bdelbruck_1), who at the end of the nineteenth century organized all the earlier study and research into a coherent form.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) commented, “In common with all modern linguists I have leaned upon [Brugmann](bio.karlbrugmann_1) and [Delbrück](bio.bdelbruck_1) as masters in linguistic learning.”  
Similarly, [William Dwight Whitney](bio.williamdwightwhitney)’s Sanskrit Grammar is cited throughout the “Big Grammar,” for [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) saw that “constant use of the Sanskrit must be made by one who wishes to understand the historical developments of the Greek tongue.”
By the time [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) had written his earliest articles on Greek grammar for the Seminary Magazine, he had determined the historical framework that would underlie his “Big Grammar.”
However, one problem still existed.
What is the exact relationship of New Testament Greek to the language as a whole?
In 1900 [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) had characterized New Testament Greek as “a variety of the current Greek of the first century A.D., with a strong Semitic influence… .
There is a slight Latin tinge, a distinctively Christian character, and various dialectical marks.”  
It is evident that the uniqueness of the Greek of the New Testament gave [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) a little trouble in fitting it into the framework of historical grammar.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s determination to solve this problem led to one of his greatest contributions, his delineation of the precise nature of New Testament Greek.
By comparing the phonology, onomatology, vocabulary, inflections, syntax, and style of the New Testament with a great variety of inscriptions, papyri, and ostraca, [Adolf Deissmann](bio.adolfdeissmann) had showed that the New Testament is late colloquial Greek.
[Deissmann](bio.adolfdeissmann)’s position was that “for the most part, the pages of our sacred Book are so many records of popular Greek, in its various grades.” [James Hope Moulton](bio.JamesMoulton.1)
[James Hope Moulton](bio.JamesMoulton.1), carrying [Deissmann](bio.adolfdeissmann)’s work over into the grammatical sphere, concluded from his investigation of papyri that the Greek of the New Testament is the vernacular Greek of the period.
[Deissmann](bio.adolfdeissmann)’s and [Moulton](bio.JamesMoulton.1)’s investigations convinced [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) that the grammar of the Greek of the New Testament is the grammar of the vernacular Koine of the first century A.D. [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) did not agree with them, however, that New Testament Greek is merely the vernacular: “The joy of new discovery has to some extent blurred the vision of [Deissmann](bio.adolfdeissmann) and [Moulton](bio.JamesMoulton.1) to the remaining Hebraisms which do not indeed make Hebraic Greek or a peculiar dialect.
But enough remain to be noticeable and appreciable.”
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s presuppositions concerning the New Testament gave a unique emphasis to his work in Greek grammar and in New Testament interpretation.
He considered the Bible as God’s Word in a sense that extended to the particular shades of meaning in the Greek.
Hence a minute study of the Greek is necessary for a correct understanding of [God](bk.#God)’s Word.
While recognizing that the Greek of the New Testament is basically the common dialect of the Hellenistic world, and that the various writers of the New Testament used it correctly, he also maintained that New Testament Greek is characterized by fine distinctions which must be carefully investigated.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s method of close investigation coordinated study of words, phrases, and sentences with judgments concerning the major themes of larger sections:
Read the epistle several times, seek the occasion and purpose of its writing.
Analyze it carefully.
Then take it up section by section, slowly, painstakingly, conscientiously, digging out everything from [Thayer](bio.williamgreenoughthayershedd) and the commentaries.
Make the section cover only what falls under one leading idea.
By the time you have done this one section, go back and start over again.
But for [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) interpretation was not only an intellectual matter.
Indeed, “the head cannot get all the meaning out of [God](bk.#God)’s Word.”
So he stressed that it is sometimes necessary to rely upon faith to help clarify the truths of the Bible.
Through this “experiential reliance” and pious living many passages of Scripture can be opened up.
“After all our study and experience,” [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) said, “we need the help of the Holy Spirit to understand properly the Word of God… .
He will help us if we ask him.”
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s grammatical study and his work of interpretation fall together under the comprehensive vocation of preaching.
It will be recalled that [Broadus](bio.johnalbertbroadus) was not only professor of New Testament interpretation but also professor of homiletics.
And [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s initial faculty appointment was as an assistant professor of Greek and homiletics.
[Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson) thought of himself first and foremost as a preacher.
So when asked whether preaching, teaching, or writing was the highest kind of service, he replied, “Preaching!
Yes, preaching is the greatest work in the world.
The element in the other two that makes them worthwhile is the preaching that they contain.”  
He went on to declare that he had never considered himself as anything other than a preacher.
Indeed, the major purpose in writing the “Big Grammar” was to help others to preach the Word.
In later editions he expressed particular gratitude that preachers were finding it helpful: “It is gratifying to know that ministers are using it in their studies as one of the regular tools in the shop.
My own reward for the long years of devotion to this grammar is found in the satisfaction that scholarly ministers are using the book for their own enrichment.”
Grounded in the most current methods and sources, [Robertson](bio.archibaldthomasrobertson)’s contributions to the study of New Testament Greek transcended ideological boundaries.
For that reason they continue to be of use.
His mastery of Greek grammar combined with his conventional conservative approach to critical and interpretative questions makes him a valuable resource for conservative and evangelical Christians even today.

# [Richard C. H. Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)/[Robert Rosin](bio.robertlrosin)

“Swiftly and silently the angel of death addressed the final summons to Dr. [Richard Charles Henry Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) at an early hour on Friday, August 14.
And the soul of this weary and worn laborer in the Lord’s kingdom answered the angel’s bidding without a struggle and peacefully followed the heavenly messenger into the realms of eternal glory.”
So read the opening lines of the obituary run in the Church News of Columbus, Ohio, in the summer of 1936.
Purple prose by modern standards, but those who have come to appreciate the contributions of [Richard Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) will find more drama than melodrama in those words, which capture the richness, the sense of purpose, and the devotion that marked his life and career.
We no longer write obituaries that way, just as biblical scholars no longer write commentaries in [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s style, but both impress us with a measured grace from a bygone era that can still teach today.
[Richard Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was acknowledged to be a man of principle and conviction, and there was little doubt about where he stood when it came to efforts at cooperation between different Lutheran groups.
How he went about voicing those convictions proved problematic for people both within his own church body and in wider Lutheran circles.
That he was in a position to make his voice heard is testimony to his bearing and to his scholarship, which crossed disciplines and left a legacy that continues to influence Evangelical Lutherans.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was an educated pastor and a pastoral educator.
Especially from his post at Capital University, where he became a fixture as he taught and wrote, he clearly influenced both his close associates and the wider sweep of Lutheranism.
About thirty-five miles northeast of Berlin in the small Prussian town of Greiffenberg, [Richard Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was born on September 14, 1864.
Like so many others in Prussia and territories under its shadow, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s parents became part of the German Auswanderung, emigrating to Jackson, Michigan, where his father supported the family as a tailor.
Although they had left their homeland, the Germans brought much of their educational structures and curriculum with them.
So at age fourteen [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) began his preparatory studies and continued at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio.  
He received his B.A. in 1885 and stayed for seminary.
When Lutherans in America decided to train their own pastors rather than rely on Europe, the basic options were to adopt individual tutorial education or to found schools.
Since the former produced uneven and often inadequate results, theological schools became the choice.
So a program was begun as Hartwick Seminary in New York City in 1797, followed by the Lutheran seminary in Gettysburg in 1826.
The Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary was founded in 1830 in Canton by the Ohio Synod.  
When the lone faculty member moved to Columbus in 1831, the school a handful of students went with him.
After a two-year start-up period the time came to find a permanent home; Columbus won a bidding war of sorts, and property was bought.
By the time [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was a student, the tiny beginning had grown to include both a seminary program and college studies, although the student body was still not large.  
The curriculum was strongly marked by languages, with other elements of the liberal arts added in later years.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) would typically have studied Latin (grammar along with readings in [Caesar](bio.cjuliuscaesar), [Ovid](bio.povidiusnaso), [Virgil](bio.virgil), [Livy](bio.livy), [Horace](bio.horace), [Cicero](bio.mtulliuscicero), [Tacitus](bio.corneliustacitus)), Greek (grammar, the Iliad, [Herodotus](bio.herodotus), [Aeschylus](bio.aeschylus), and the New Testament), Hebrew grammar, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, history, rhetoric, speech, composition (German and English), literature (German and English), logic, natural philosophy, and catechism.
The curriculum certainly made sure that serious students would be prepared for seminary.  
In fact, readying students for seminary was what the college was virtually all about.
Preparation for other careers was not emphasized; for, as can be plainly seen from the curriculum, there was nothing to point students toward the sciences.
When [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) entered seminary in 1885, the theological faculty had a grand total of three professors. [Matthias Loy](bio.matthiasloy)
[Matthias Loy](bio.matthiasloy) was the “first professor,” that is to say, the dean.
In 1881 he also had been thrust into the presidency of the entire Capital operation despite his objections, and when [C. A. Frank](bio.cafrank_1) resigned that same year, [Loy](bio.matthiasloy) found himself the only professor in the seminary program.  
Help arrived when [C. H. L. Schuette](bio.chlschuette_1) moved from the college to the seminary faculty, and [Frederick W. Stellhorn](bio.fwstellhorn) came over from the Missouri Synod after a theological dispute.  
The trio shaped [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s seminary education. [Loy](bio.matthiasloy)
[Loy](bio.matthiasloy) continued as dean and concentrated on systematics, which included catechetics, dogmatics, and pastoral theology.
[Stellhorn](bio.fwstellhorn) offered courses in hermeneutics (the principles of interpretation), exegesis (the actual interpretation of biblical books), isagogics (the background of biblical books; i.e., matters like authorship and date), and church history.
[Schuette](bio.chlschuette_1) taught practical theology, which included homiletics and symbolics (the official statements and doctrines of various church bodies).
The three-man faculty proceeded to revise teaching methods and curriculum.
Rather than deliver each lecture in both German and English, they alternated languages from lecture to lecture, saving them double work and forcing the students to learn how to think theologically in both languages.
A decade earlier a move had already begun to make more use of textbooks and end the old dictation style where students simply copied notes read in class.
That trend continued under [Loy](bio.matthiasloy) as professors offered comments as they moved through the reading material that consisted of classic German titles.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) benefited from the recently revised curriculum.
The oddest feature of the three-year curriculum was that a student did not take courses with just his own class.
That would have meant offering every course each year.
Instead the entire student body sat together and took a given year’s courses.
Students would begin with whatever happened to be offered at the time; thus each course would have beginners together with students finishing their seminary training.
That is hardly ideal.
But the seminary had only three professors, and with extracurricular expectations laid on them by the synod, that was the way it had to be.
Still, substantial progress had been made by the time [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) arrived, with Capital becoming a “theoretical seminary” whose entering students were expected to have a good classical background.
Those seminarians could then explore theology in depth rather than worry about developing practical skills.
The languages learned in the preparatory college years were particularly important, for students in [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s era could be expected to do exegesis based on Greek and Hebrew.
At the same time, the high level of expectation collided with the needs of the synod.
Strict requirements whittled down the number of potential students, and as the enrollment dropped, the synod had fewer graduates for vacant congregations.
A possible solution was to start a “practical seminary” like the Missouri Synod’s school in Springfield, Illinois, where students would work with the German Bible not as desirable as the Capital curriculum, but something had to be done.  
Yet a second seminary would take several years to get off the ground.
In the meantime the shortage of pastors forced the adoption of a second solution, namely, abbreviating the three-year plan.
So after only his second year [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s studies were broken off, and he was on his way to a congregation in Baltimore a church outside the Midwest but still a member of the Joint Synod.
In the next few years [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) returned to the state of Ohio to serve synodical congregations at Trenton, Springfield, and Anna.
He also was elected president of the western district of the synod.
Along the way in 1890 he received an M.A. from the Columbus seminary, which would also award him a D.D. in 1915.

## Professorship at the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary (Capital University)

In 1911 [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) returned to Columbus as a member of the seminary faculty.
He remained at his alma mater for twenty-five years.
Although he taught some exegesis during his years there, and his name would become associated primarily with his commentary series, he was also a professor of dogmatics and homiletics, a combination that helps explain his approach to exegesis.
The dogmatic outlook colors the texts of his commentaries.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) returned at a time when Capital was undergoing significant changes.
Throughout its history the college and seminary had shared space and, to some degree, faculty as well.
But the seminary faculty had become convinced that this mixture was not good for the students’ social and educational development.
Moreover, the seminary suffered because of the professors’ heavy involvement in the college program.
The school’s need for some new facilities gave the synod the opportunity to separate the two programs and to curtail some of the seminary faculty’s involvement in the college program.
Ironically, one of [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s duties upon arriving at the seminary was to teach Greek at the college.
At least this was something that fed directly into his seminary teaching.
The move toward new buildings got off to an uneven start as funding stalled, but the effort to bring in new faculty went well.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was one of those new appointments.
[Loy](bio.matthiasloy) had retired in 1902, making [Stellhorn](bio.fwstellhorn) senior faculty member.
Now [Stellhorn](bio.fwstellhorn)’s health forced him to reduce his load and prompted a search for help.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was a natural choice: a graduate of Capital with extensive experience in the parish and church administration; a protégé of [Stellhorn](bio.fwstellhorn); and the editor of the synod’s German language periodical, the Lutherische Kirchenzeitung.
[Stellhorn](bio.fwstellhorn) remained officially the first professor, but [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was the one who made things perk, in the classroom and beyond.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s energy was brought to bear on efforts to improve Capital’s curriculum.
He himself had been a student when the school was geared exclusively to pastoral education.
Now [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) supported the teaching of science at the college.
Since 1894 there had been feeble efforts at introducing courses in science, but there had been tepid response, so [Schuette](bio.chlschuette_1), now Capital’s president, suggested at the 1912 Joint Synod meeting that science be dropped since it did not pay for itself.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski), however, editorialized in the Kirchenzeitung in behalf of the courses, noting that science credits earned at Capital were accepted at Ohio State University, so the program must be respectable and ought to be retained to give the college a better balance.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s side won out when the convention referred the matter back to the school’s administration and board.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) thus demonstrated that there was more to him than narrow theology.
A year after [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s arrival in 1911, [Otto Mees](bio.ottomees_1) was installed as Capital’s new president.
The son of faculty member [Theophilus Mees](bio.theophilusmees_1), the new president was said to have a progressive outlook, while [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was known as an “old Lutheran” with a traditional, conservative, confessional perspective.
Since [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s student days, the seminary had grown and the faculty now numbered five full-time members.
But in terms of outlook and attitude the seminary was settling into a calm, which was already evident during [Loy](bio.matthiasloy)’s last years at the helm.
As the new century moved forward, it was imperative that the seminary not be left in its wake.
For a while, distractions with the First World War stood in the way, but the seminary faculty and [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) soon had their opportunity.
With the school in need of a curricular shot in the arm, both [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) and [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) brought much-needed energy to the task, but their different outlooks produced friction along the way.  
It must be noted that the heat that was generated came not from substantial theological differences but from differences in style, from what each thought important to accent.
Later, when [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) was under fire from the more conservative elements, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) showed integrity by making sure that they understood where the problems lay and that [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) was not pilloried for what he had not done or said.
Ever since his return, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) had acted as the virtual dean because of [Stellhorn](bio.fwstellhorn)’s poor health.
Outside the classroom he provided additional leadership by fostering theological discussion in an extracurricular student group that he served as an advisor.  
Yet when it came time to formally replace [Stellhorn](bio.fwstellhorn) as dean in 1919, [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) did not want [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski).
The board of directors, however, overruled the president on this matter.
In the decade that followed, the seminary seemed to follow [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s lead in displaying an “old Lutheran” spirit.
Two faculty members who died were not immediately replaced, a situation that put a strain on the three men left and forced college faculty to fill in.
But in 1927 the board moved to ease the strain and restructured the seminary into four chairs or departments.
Lenski was assigned systematics, [P. H. Beuhring](bio.phbeuhring_1) exegesis, and [G. C. Gast](bio.gcgast_1) historical theology, while a new man, [Jacob Dell](bio.jacobdell_1), was brought in to handle practical theology.
In 1929 more help arrived in the area of exegesis: when the Buffalo Synod closed its seminary after merging with the Iowa Synod, [Herbert Leupold](bio.herbertleupold_1) moved over to Capital as professor of Old Testament.
That made a full complement of five again, most of whom were generally in step with [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s old Lutheran views. [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was especially impressed by the Missouri Synod’s confessional intensity as were some of his faculty.
Still, Dean [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) found his faculty’s integrity challenged at times in the 1920s.  
The Ohio Synod certainly ranked among the theologically conservative Lutheran bodies, while there was no doubt that the United Lutheran Church in America (ULCA) had staked out the liberal end of the spectrum, especially if one were to ask an old Lutheran like [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski).
Conservatives were particularly rankled by unionism and the tendency to look the other way when church members joined secret societies.  
At the start of the decade, Ohio Synod President [C. C. Hein](bio.cchein_1), who may have been more conservative than [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) (if that were possible), upset the dean when in public he rather nastily termed Capital “the best seminary of the ULCA.”
At a meeting that [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) arranged between [Hein](bio.cchein_1) and the faculty, it became clear that the progressive [Otto Mees](bio.ottomees_1) was the focus of [Hein](bio.cchein_1)’s comments.
(This is the case where [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) made sure that [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) was not unjustly condemned.)
No notes were made, but in the end [Hein](bio.cchein_1) apparently was satisfied that [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) was basically conservative although relatively progressive in his style and methods.
Since the seminary was keen to defend its reputation, a statement was drafted maintaining that there was no problem between [Hein](bio.cchein_1) and [Mees](bio.ottomees_1), that the faculty’s conservatism was not in question, and that they had no interest in entertaining liberalism.
[Hein](bio.cchein_1) was to publicize the statement to make sure that Capital was not wrongly criticized.
The episode typifies [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski).
Staunch confessional Lutheranism was essential to him, as was his seminary’s reputation as a voice thereof.
When a challenge arose, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) reacted decisively.
The matter was especially serious because the critic was the synod’s president.
Principle prevented [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) from letting the remark pass.
Rather than fret in private or wage a countercampaign through third parties and backdoor channels, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) confronted the matter bluntly yet with propriety: a private meeting in which the concerned parties could be honest with each other was arranged.
All that shows integrity on his part.
In addition, the summary statement speaks well of [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s role.
First, any notion of a personal rift was put to rest, so the synod would not whisper about any supposed problem between [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) and [Hein](bio.cchein_1).
Any tension between [Mees](bio.ottomees_1) and [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was also set aside.
Then, too, the faculty’s good name was defended.
Because those involved were satisfied that there was no substantial problem and wanted to ensure that no reputations would be ruined, it was necessary to “put the best construction on everything,” as [Martin Luther](bio.martinluther) had phrased it in his Small Catechism explanation of the commandment against false witness.
But there was no hollow posturing for [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) just to save face and smooth the matter over.
He insisted on substance behind the words.
He also expected people to step forward for principle and bear witness plainly.
That blunt, straight-arrow approach worked here, and in the end all concerned seemed satisfied.
At the same time [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s traits could bring some grief.
Of course, we would not prefer equivocation or laud duplicity, but there are times when a certain diplomacy might in the long run serve truth better.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) seemed intent on always being direct.
But was he always right?
It might have been better sometimes to pause and check before pressing ahead.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s intensity could compound problems when, as later events would prove, he was wrong.
Examples include his 1924 quarrel with local pastor [Charles Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1) and his criticism of the National Lutheran Council.

## The Penchant for Controversy

[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s blunt manner triggered the incident with [Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1). [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) had claimed that the president of Wittenberg College, [R. E. Tulloss](bio.retulloss_1), belonged to the Masons, a secret society.
After [Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1)’s defense of the man had proved [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) wrong, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) published an apology that was blunt but, in [Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1)’s opinion, inadequate.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) expressed regret for any harm done to [Tulloss](bio.retulloss_1)’s reputation, but he also suggested that he bore no blame since he had acted honestly on wrong information.
He did not acknowledge that he should have been better informed before going public.
Unsatisfied with the apology, [Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1) challenged [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s integrity.
Efforts by church-appointed mediators did not placate [Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1), who then launched charges of his own, claiming [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) had maligned yet another pastor and was a money-grubber.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) had been preaching at a church while its pastor was on sick leave.
When the congregation suggested that they might engage someone else to help out as well, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) allegedly implied some problem with the man’s theology hence the charge of maligning another pastor.
And by blocking the man from the pulpit [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) assured that he would continue to be paid for preaching hence [Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1)’s claim of greed.
If there were truth to [Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1)’s charge, it was made to look ridiculous when he argued that [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) not only was well paid as a professor whose income was augmented by book royalties, but also made money on the side by selling flower bulbs.
([Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was known for his gladiolus collection of some 450 varieties his hobby.)
Though this was serious business at first with its accusation of Masonry, the situation quickly degenerated and might even have been funny if so much time had not been wasted and the contending parties not been so petty.
[Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1) would not quit until he proved [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) wrong and forced a public admission, though several mediation committees, trying to end the fray, dismissed his complaints.
On the other side, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) did not help matters with his attitude.
His original editorial attack had his typical vigor.
But when he realized that he had been careless and had something to apologize for, he could not bring himself to admit personal fault.
And his dismissive attitude only infuriated [Pflueger](bio.charlespflueger_1).
In the greater scheme of things, this was a small matter, but it illustrates the downside of [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s authoritarian manner.
Having rushed into an error, he had deflected the blame so that he could also claim to be a victim.
The same pattern drew [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) into a much larger argument that affected whole synods associated with the National Lutheran Council (NLC).
Along with teaching and administrative duties, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) continued to edit the Lutherische Kirchenzeitung, one of the Joint Synod’s publishing outlets and the vehicle through which he had made his charge against Wittenberg’s president.
In a series of editorials, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) also attacked the NLC.
The NLC had been formally launched in 1918 as a combined effort of several Lutheran bodies.
The year before, they had joined in an ad hoc effort to publicize the four hundredth anniversary of the posting of Luther’s Ninety-five Theses.
In addition, the national Lutheran Commission for Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Welfare was formed in 1917 to minister to those in the armed forces, and the Lutheran Bureau was established as a publicity agency.
Those efforts evolved into the NLC, organized in Chicago in October 1918.
No formal constitution was adopted, perhaps to keep the support of more reluctant, conservative participants.
The organization operated instead with a simple statement of purpose.
Among the functions were the provision of statistical information on Lutheran bodies, publicity, public relations, coordination of the activities of the constituent groups, encouragement of a national interest in Christianity, and the monitoring of church-state relations.
From the beginning some groups were uneasy about how much their involvement in the NLC linked them to church bodies with which they were not in close fellowship or communion vis-à-vis the Word and sacraments.
There was debate within the more conservative church bodies about what could be done in good conscience and what constituted unionism.
Though not the most reluctant member, the Joint Synod was troubled by the convictions of some other members.
And among the Ohioans [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was a prominent critic, voicing his complaints in the pages of the Kirchenzeitung.
While [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was not so extreme as to say that because everything has worship overtones, there could be no intersynodical efforts, he did editorialize against what he thought was a lax attitude that did not sufficiently test the spirits.
In short, he did not rule cooperative activities out on principle but had problems with the practice.
A similar evaluation might be made of his critics: they admired [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s staunch orthodoxy, but they objected to the way he launched his assault.
In 1919 the NLC sent observers to take note of the physical needs of Europe in the wake of the Great War.
As a result, financial aid was channeled to a variety of countries (except Germany, which was still closed by order of the Allies).
Congregations were supported and pastors’ salaries were supplemented in the hope that Lutheranism might be strengthened.
But back in America some Lutherans wondered if this sort of assistance might let in fellowship via the back door.
They thought the confessional position of these churches and pastors was inadequate.
They would not have funded them in normal circumstances, but here they were offering support.
Was this fellowship in a roundabout way?
A related question was whether all the members of the NLC had to be in full agreement before they acted as a unit.
At this point the difference between res externae, matters external to the basic purpose of the church in its use of Word and sacraments, and res internae, matters essential or integral to the church’s mission and ministry, came into play.
There was a debate as to whether the NLC’s activities were no more than external matters.
[Johann Michael Reu](bio.johannmichaelreu) of the Iowa Synod and [Richard Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) were two of the sharper critics.
They preferred that the NLC confine its activities to identifying needs and then let others provide funding.
The NLC ought not give the money itself, thus supporting the ministry of some who were more liberal.
Within the NLC, caution was sounded lest such critics be given more ammunition: “[We] must try to keep the Council’s record very clear indeed, so that we may be in a position to make our real fight against the reactionaries with a prospect of success.”
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski), one of the “reactionaries” mentioned, feared unionism and would not be deterred in his criticism.
In 1920 he published a series of editorials targeting the NLC as being not simply weak but anticonfessional.
Complaints against [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) prompted his colleague [C. H. L. Schuette](bio.chlschuette_1) to call a joint meeting of the seminary faculty and the pastors on the synodical publication board.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) objected, noting there were no constitutional grounds for such an inquiry.
Nevertheless, the meeting took place on March 5, 1921.
The minutes of the meeting are quite revealing.  
At one point [Schuette](bio.chlschuette_1) challenged [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski): “I ask you on your honor, is it not in your mind to discredit the NLC?”
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) replied, “What is in my mind is between myself and [God](bk.#God).
He who interprets my words must also answer to [God](bk.#God) for his interpretation.”
That exchange suggests a great deal.
It seems that the problem was not only with the substance of what [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) wrote a misrepresentation of the NLC, some believed but also with how he went about voicing his objections.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was not about to be drawn into that discussion.
It was enough to consider his conduct and actions, not inner, private thoughts.  
Lest anyone want to press the matter, he asserted defiantly, [God](bk.#God) waits as judge.
That was true enough, but [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s reply was sure to grate.
Later in the meeting Pastor [H. J. Schuh](bio.johnhschuh_1) noted that [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) had criticized the way in which money was being spent (or, more precisely, not being spent), even though he had yet to see a full public report on how funds were being managed.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) replied that he had acted on the basis of the minutes of meetings to which he was privy; minutes, he argued, were more honest than later public reports that would be sanitized and couched to obtain maximum support from church members who were honest and trusting but essentially ignorant.
So he was doing the NLC a service by giving early warning and precluding the necessity of recouping favor through public relations.
This episode has echoes of [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s apology for the charge against [Tulloss](bio.retulloss_1): he had acted on the basis of the information he had and thus was not culpable, even though later information mitigated matters.
In this instance [Schuh](bio.johnhschuh_1) noted that the funds held back by the NLC funds [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) wanted spent were being kept in reserve lest the NLC be caught without resources should some dire emergency suddenly come to light.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) countered by arguing that he was not at fault for prematurely criticizing; rather, the NLC was responsible because of the impression it had created.
By amassing so much money the NLC had forced him to be critical.
As [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) told [Schuh](bio.johnhschuh_1), “In my opinion that sum was entirely too large that is my impression.
I can only publish my impressions.”
Other participants in the meeting then reminded [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) that the Kirchenzeitung was not his personal vehicle but belonged to the church, so he ought to show more responsibility.
Said [Schuette](bio.chlschuette_1), “The Kirchenzeitung is not your personal property.
We want facts, not your personal impressions.”
The committee pointed out that [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) had discredited the NLC because of his personal conclusions, not because of any official judgment or opposition from the synod.
They objected to [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s refusal to print information disseminated by the NLC for publication in official periodicals.
Moreover, whenever he did agree to print some of this information, he sometimes edited in or out what he wanted and so gave an impression different from what was intended.
In reference to a specific instance came the question, “Why do you omit that last clause?
That is dishonest.
Missourian policies.”
Though this statement was intended as a rebuke, old-style [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) would have taken it as a compliment.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) came close to an admission when he stated, “All you have said I appreciate, and I interpret it without casting any reproach on you.
But what you brethren have just heard, if translated into acts, will work harm… .
Men in our Synod will go into open unionism under the guidance of the NLC… .
What we wish to do is to save the situation.
Of course one may be overzealous in a good cause.”
Asked for proof of unionism, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) replied, “Its [the NLC’s] work has led into unionistic directions.”
The notes make it clear that the committeemen were not pleased with this response.
Yet they were unwilling to say too much since, as [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) had noted, the meeting itself was constitutionally irregular.
Their final statement acknowledged his editorial privilege, but noted that editorial privilege did not grant him the right to misrepresent the NLC or the ULCA.
They had no power to order change, but they urged the Joint Synod president to do so.
Throughout the exchange [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s orthodoxy was never challenged.
In the committee’s view he certainly knew what was right doctrinally.
But how he interpreted the actions of others here the NLC and how he then went about voicing criticism were both weaknesses.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) should have been pleased that the committee differentiated between doctrine and practice, and he ought to have conceded that people can differ honestly on the latter and that he might have acted otherwise.
But not only did he see no real problem with his practice, he mixed his practice up with doctrine, saying that had he not acted as he did, he would have failed the cause of doctrine, failed to defend the truth.
A personal statement filed a week later on March 12 solidly defended his position.
His objections to the proceedings were repeated, followed by detailed justifications of the judgments rendered in his editorials.
The statement added up to a rejection of the charge that he had misrepresented the NLC and its representatives.
At the meeting and in his subsequent statement [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) made no concession that he could be wrong.
His views, he contended, should have been given more consideration, especially his concern that well-intentioned efforts that seem to present no problem in the short term may lead to erosion in the long run.
He was concerned about denominational integrity.
It is ironic that some years later when a local Columbus congregation in the United Lutheran Church asked Capital Seminary for a student assistant, the faculty declined the request, not on the basis of the congregation’s theological position, but out of the need to maintain “synodical loyalty.”  
The irony is that this response of the faculty, including some who had criticized [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski), was akin to what [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) himself had argued regarding the NLC’s granting of financial aid to meet the needs in postwar Europe: while the immediate participants in the program might not have presented a problem, there should have been an awareness of the overtones of larger ties.
If there was a potential problem, it was better to find another way to meet the needs.
The answer was not to let people suffer, but to create some other channel for dispensing aid.
The issue seemed to be how to weigh the needs for relief against the synod’s reputation and identity.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was more concerned about the latter, a position that certainly should be respected.
His critics should have been pressed to answer why alternative methods and channels could not have been found for the overseas work.
But his tone made it hard for some to appreciate his stance.
After all was said and done, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) remained the editor of the Kirchenzeitung; by the time he stepped down, he had held the post for twenty years (1904–24).
While the brouhaha over the NLC editorials got much attention, it should not be stressed disproportionately, for [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) produced much for the benefit of his church.
Others were not pleased at the time, but had they thought his position a fatal error, someone else would have replaced [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) immediately.
Instead he stayed several more years.

## Writings

Because it was natural for [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) to turn to print to educate others, he had been a prolific writer since his days in the parish ministry.
He began in 1895 with his Biblische Frauenbilder, a volume on women of the Bible; its articles had originally been talks to the Ladies’ Society of Zion Lutheran, his congregation in Springfield.
In 1898 he published in English for the first time:
His Footsteps consisted of devotions based on the life of [Christ](bk.#Jesus).
To the commonly used Eisenach lectionary series he contributed Eisenach Gospel Selections (1910) and Eisenach Epistle Selections (1914).
St. [Paul](bk.#Paul) (1916) was followed by New Gospel Selections Made Ready for Pulpit Work (1919) and The Active Church Member (1922).
He returned to the Eisenach series with Eisenach Old Testament Selections in 1925.
In 1927 he published both Kings and Priests: The Universal Priesthood of Believers, his book most oriented toward dogmatics, and The Sermon: Its Homiletical Construction.
The latter grew out of one of his chief teaching areas.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s string of monographs continued with St. [John](bio.john_1) in 1929 and The Epistle Selections of the Ancient Church in 1935.
Finally, The Gospel Selections of the Ancient Church came off the press the very week of his death in 1936.
Given the teaching expectations and the work involved in editing the synod’s Lutherische Kirchenzeitung, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s output is astounding.
But our list is far from complete.
During the 1920s, while busy on other titles, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) did the spadework on what would become his New Testament commentaries.
Released between 1931 and 1938, the eleven volumes were grouped in a series as The Interpretation of the New Testament.
Though many other commentaries have come in the decades since, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s remain on the worktables of many Evangelical Lutheran pastors.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s commentaries evoke interesting reactions.
He made much of language and vocabulary.
Rather than speculate about what passages might mean, he focused on grammar and particular words in a pericope.
His tendency was to argue for an interpretation on the basis of a particular word or grammatical construction.
For the most part this can produce fruitful results.
After all, words and grammar are there to help define and express meaning.
The problem comes when a point is pressed beyond what it can bear.
Thus he might say that something is always the case when it is only mostly the case.
Or he might draw a conclusion on the basis of an overly subtle semantic distinction.  
There is a danger in narrowly fixing on a word or phrase that, while it deserves attention, ought to be seen also in the wider sweep.
Looking at words in isolation should be accompanied by examining them in their wider textual and cultural context.
As [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) extracts dogmatic lessons, Romans, Galatians, and Corinthians begin to look more like each other than they otherwise might.
In addition, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) sometimes argues in circles.
He will contend that a certain grammatical construction leads to a theological conclusion; then, in expounding the basis of his view of the grammatical construction, he points to that very theological conclusion.
The saving grace here is that he comes out in the right place theologically.
That is because he reads the New Testament with an evangelical outlook and from deep Lutheran roots.
To take just one example, his exposition of 5 builds on the categories of objective and subjective justification even though those terms do not explicitly appear, being familiar to students of Lutheran dogmatics.  
That is just the sort of discussion one would expect to find.
In general, when it comes to understanding the doctrinal import of passages, [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) does well.
How he arrives at that point has bothered some later exegetes, though they still appreciate the theology that [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) finds there.
This is not to dismiss [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s commentaries, but to note reservations about individual exegetical examples and to be aware of some of his tendencies.
In fact, the undertaking was titanic and succeeded admirably at understanding the New Testament in an evangelical way.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) clearly thought in terms of law and gospel; thus a doctrinal coherence shines through as he explains the varied New Testament texts.
His results, his conclusions are solidly Lutheran.
(A colleague sums up [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s achievements this way: Seminary professors would like all students to be linguistic geniuses, but many will struggle with exegesis.
Then they ought to have [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski), for he will keep them focused and help them think through the text in evangelical terms.)
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was fortunate to have accomplished much in the 1920s toward preparing his commentaries for publication in the next decade.
For in the 1930s his health took a turn for the worse.  
Students knew him for his tall, erect stature and piercing gray eyes, but diabetes began to take its toll.
He continued with his commentaries even as his strength waned.
After a leave of absence in 1929–30 he returned to his duties, but it was largely his will that carried him through.
In 1935 he gave up his administrative duties and cut back his teaching to five hours a week.
The end came early Friday morning, August 14, 1936.
He left behind his wife, the former [Helen Gruner](bio.helengruner_1), and five children, including [Gerhard](bio.gerhardlenski_1), a pastor in Washington, D.C.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) had planned his own funeral service.
[A. C. Schiff](bio.acschiff_1) of Columbus was the officiant, and [Glen Seamon](bio.glenseamon_1), [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s pastor at St. [Peter](bk.#Peter)’s, preached.
He was buried in Green Lawn Cemetery, where other Capital faculty had been laid to rest.
He wanted everything done simply with no fanfare.
That extended even to his obituary.
[G. C. Gast](bio.gcgast_1), who was then editing Church News (Kirchenzeitung in its English format), felt obliged to write an explanation for those readers who would expect more than one column: “Repeatedly and very urgently Dr. [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) requested the editor of this department to limit the account of his death in these columns to an unadorned record of a few objective facts of his life and his work.
Very reluctantly we consented, and are hereby endeavoring to redeem the pledge made to our departed colleague.”
Others followed suit so that it is difficult to lay hold of information on [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski), especially on his private life.
But his work survives in abundance, and his influence lives on as his writings continue to produce fruit.
[Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) would be pleased.
[Richard Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) was a dominant figure in Lutheranism in the first third of the twentieth century.
He stood tall for “old Lutheranism.”
To be sure, he could be controversial, but he was most certainly not without principle.
His convictions and his commitment and love of classic Lutheran confessional theology drove him.
It seems clear that there were times when he pressed farther than he ought, times he loosed public polemics that may not have helped matters.
But his confrontations have to be balanced against his years of faithful service in many avenues.
His manner could be irritating and infuriating, but he also received tremendous love and respect from those around him at the seminary, the kind of admiration that has to be earned, not commanded.
In his memory students donated to the seminary library four art-glass windows depicting the four Evangelists, and part of the building is named in his honor.
It is a fitting memorial, given all that [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski) wrote.
He left behind twenty-three volumes and a host of editorials, some fifteen thousand pages devoted to building up the body of [Christ](bk.#Christ).
An author, an editor, a pastor who served in parishes, and a professor who helped educate pastors [Lenski](bio.RichardCHLenski)’s is a rich legacy that continues to enliven evangelical circles.

# [Oswald T. Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)/[John H. Skilton](bio.johnhskilton_1)

Educator, clergyman, author, and editor, [Oswald Thompson Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) was an influential defender of the Christian faith in the twentieth century.
His specialty was the Old Testament, and he was an accomplished counterpart to his long-term colleague at Princeton and Westminister Seminaries, [J. Gresham Machen](bio.JohnMachen), whose chief field of emphasis was the New Testament.
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) was born on September 9, 1880, in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, where his family was staying temporarily.
Their home was in downtown Philadelphia, where [Oswald](bio.OswaldAllis) grew up.
His father, [Oscar Huntington Allis](bio.oscarhuntingtonallis_1), was a physician of distinction with recognized teaching skills.
Not only was he a teacher of medical subjects in hospitals, but he had earlier been a schoolteacher.
In fact, [Oswald](bio.OswaldAllis)’s mother, [Julia Waterbury Thompson](bio.juliawaterburythompson_1), had taken special work in German language and literature under [Oscar Allis](bio.oscarhuntingtonallis_1) before they were married.
Her father was [Oswald Thompson](bio.OswaldAllis), president judge in the court of common pleas in Philadelphia.
The Allis line in the United States went back to [William Allis](bio.williamallis_1), who came to Massachusetts in 1630.
[Galbraith Hall Todd](bio.galbraithhalltodd_1) reports in his biography of [Oswald Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) that “the hereditary background of Dr. [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) has deep roots in colonial America, especially Puritan New England, and includes many ministers and persons of cultivation, with prestige in the political and educational fields.”

## Education

[Oswald](bio.OswaldAllis) benefited from his father’s competence as a teacher, for he was home-taught until he was twelve years old.
His parents’ interest in German language and literature undoubtedly prepared him for his scholarly use of German in his doctoral studies in Berlin and beyond.
Philadelphia provided a very stimulating background for [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s early years.
Its variety of historical, cultural, and natural attractions must have nurtured and delighted his mind and spirit.
From his home it was an easy walk to Independence Hall and historic Philadelphia; to the Academy of Music, which was quite near; to the University of Pennsylvania and other centers of art, literature, and science; to City Hall and the palatial Wanamaker store; to commercial and manufacturing establishments; to the seemingly endless Fairmount Park, which brought the country right into the city.
[Oswald](bio.OswaldAllis) must have been deeply influenced also by the religious environment in which he was brought up.
He was reared in a Christian home in a city of churches in a day when churches were well attended.
He was baptized and later made profession of faith in [Christ](bk.#Christ) in the Presbyterian church.
His lifelong concern for Sabbath observance must have been encouraged by the fact that in Philadelphia there was little commercial or public recreational activity on the Lord’s Day.
When [Oswald](bio.OswaldAllis) was twelve, he attended the Penn Charter School, and then the following year he went to the Delancey School.
In 1897 he entered the University of Pennsylvania, where he gave his chief attention to scientific studies.
The year 1902 brought a dramatic new development in [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s life.
In that year he entered Princeton Theological Seminary, and came under the influence of some of the great scholars who had brought distinction to that school.
In the preface to his last work, The Old Testament: Its Claims and Its Critics, he expresses his indebtedness to the Old Princeton: “It was the privilege of the writer to study at Princeton Seminary under men who held firmly to the great tradition on which that institution was founded, men who not merely believed but gloried in that pervasive supernaturalism which alone can be called truly biblical.
And he has felt that in striving to defend the heritage of unfeigned faith in the Holy Scriptures which dwelt in that noble succession of teachers, among whom [Joseph Addison Alexander](bio.josephaddisonalexander), [William Henry Green](bio.WilliamHenryGreen) and [Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) were so eminent, he was repaying in some measure the debt which he owed these mighty men of [God](bk.#God).”
The speaker at the opening exercises in 1902 was [Robert Dick Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1), who had studied in Berlin and took as his subject an issue that was being discussed there at the time.
The address was entitled “Babylon and Israel: A Comparison of Their Leading Ideas Based upon Their Vocabularies.”  
This was an effective response to a lecture which [Friedrich Delitzsch](bio.FriedrichDelitzsch) had given in Berlin in January of 1902.
In this lecture, “Babel und Bibel,” [Delitzsch](bio.FriedrichDelitzsch) had attempted to show that a large number of the beliefs of Israel were derived from Babylon and that the law of [Moses](bk.#Moses) was greatly indebted to the code of Hammurabi.
Such theories were part of the comparative religions movement that impinged upon the authority of the biblical revelation.
They were to cause [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) concern till the end of his life.
From his first article to his last book he expresses his heartfelt conviction on the uniqueness and transcendence of the Hebrew and Christian [God](bk.#God).
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s career at Princeton seemed to foreshadow his future.
Two of the students who entered with him were [J. Gresham Machen](bio.JohnMachen) and [Clarence Edward Macartney](bio.clarenceedwardmacartney), who with [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) were to be closely identified with the battle for historic Christianity against the antisupernaturalism which was attacking the Christian world.
His close association with [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1) would also continue.
Another significant influence was his study of philosophy at nearby Princeton University, which awarded him the master of arts degree in 1907.
Well instructed and prepared to defend the Christian position, [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) went to Berlin, where he was exposed in that renowned center of Semitic studies to viewpoints quite different from his own.
He learned firsthand the presuppositions and methods of those with whom he would be contending.
His efforts culminated in his receiving the Ph.D. degree in 1913.
[Paul Woolley](bio.paulwoolley_1) has commented on [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s success in Germany: “Like many brilliant Americans of the period he pursued his graduate studies in Germany, in Berlin in this instance.
Unlike many Americans, he pursued them long enough and diligently enough to receive his doctor’s degree.”

## Teaching Career

From 1910 on, [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) served in the Old Testament department of Princeton Seminary, assisting first [John D. Davis](bio.johnddavis) and later [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1).
In 1914 he was ordained a Presbyterian minister.
In 1922 he became an assistant professor of Semitic philology.
As a teacher he was respected and admired, as Woolley has testified: “The writer had the high privilege of studying under [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) in Princeton Seminary.
He was one of the most effective teachers in that famous faculty of the early twentieth century.
Possessed of a piercing mind and of a well-nigh perfect memory, he was ideal for the teaching of Semitic languages.
He was also of superb ability in penetrating the weak defenses of much of the higher critical opinion of the day.
Even the opposition respected him.” [R. Laird Harris](bio.rlairdharris)
[R. Laird Harris](bio.rlairdharris) similarly afforded high praise to his former mentor: “As a teacher you were not only interested in heads but in hearts.
Your earnest personal faith was an encouragement to us all, and your kindly interest in us and your helpfulness on all occasions give us warm recollections of happy days under your tutelage.”
During [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s professional years, doctrinal disagreement was sweeping through the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.
This phase of the widespread fundamentalist-modernist controversy claimed the attention of [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis), [Machen](bio.JohnMachen), and their friends.
A group of conservatives met frequently in the Princeton home of [Samuel G. Craig](bio.samuelgcraig_1), editor of the Presbyterian and a trustee of Princeton Seminary, to discuss issues and develop strategies.
[Craig](bio.samuelgcraig_1)’s son Charles reported that [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) was one of the more influential members of the group.
He likened his father to the quarterback or perhaps the coach, [Machen](bio.JohnMachen) to a brilliant halfback, and [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) to a line coach “who was not only a specialist in his field, but one whose overall wisdom played an important role in the team’s success.”
Brilliant and worthy though [Craig](bio.samuelgcraig_1)’s team was, it was unable to save Princeton Seminary.
In 1929 the seminary was reorganized in the interests of a more liberal doctrinal policy.
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) saw clearly that another seminary should be formed to keep the cherished witness of Old Princeton alive.
Even before [Machen](bio.JohnMachen), who was considering another possible move, he was persuaded that positive action should be taken to establish a successor to Old Princeton right away.
With [Machen](bio.JohnMachen)’s well-considered concurrence and that of others, strenuous efforts were undertaken that resulted in the establishment of Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia in September of that very year.
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) worked assiduously toward this end.
So great was his devotion to the cause that he gave not only of himself but of his resources for its success.
At personal loss, he rented to the new seminary a building in downtown Philadelphia for the token sum of one dollar a year.
Regrettably, after serving till 1936 in the new seminary, [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) felt constrained to resign.
Disagreements over ecclesiastical strategy and vision caused a separation between men who had worked together valiantly up to this point.
They were friends and conscientious warriors, and one wishes that they had been able to continue to battle side by side against unbelief.

## Writings

However sad the division was, it did free [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) to continue his notable work of writing and editing.
His productivity was enormous, and he exerted a powerful influence for the faith at home and abroad.
His bibliography lists ten full-length books (including his dissertation in German and an unpublished manuscript on dispensationalism).  
Prominent among these volumes is The Five Books of [Moses](bk.#Moses), a classic vindication of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.
It was published in 1943, and it was still in print more than fifty years later, continuing to expose the errors of the negative, divisive criticism concerning the books of [Moses](bk.#Moses).
[R. Laird Harris](bio.rlairdharris) testified in his tribute to [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis): “I have used your Five Books of [Moses](bk.#Moses) with many classes as textbook and resource book and have found that students have been satisfied, as I have been, with the correctness of your conclusions and the value of your defense of Scripture.”  
Similarly, [W. J. Grier](bio.wjgrier_1) of Northern Ireland noted that the book “met the needs of students in British theological colleges who were contending against prevailing critical views.”
Not everyone, however, had unqualified praise for the volume.
[William F. Albright](bio.WilliamAlbright) reviewed it not without some appreciation, but with strictures. [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis), although respectful of [Albright](bio.WilliamAlbright), had taken issue in The Five Books of [Moses](bk.#Moses) with a number of his views.
It would have been helpful if these two front-ranking scholars could have confronted one another directly.
Also to be noted is that despite the great usefulness of The Five Books of [Moses](bk.#Moses) for many, it of course has not eliminated all the entrenched allegiance to the viewpoint that it opposes.
[God](bk.#God) Spake by [Moses](bk.#Moses) (1958) is designedly a more popular type of work than The Five Books of [Moses](bk.#Moses).
It is a brief running exposition of the Pentateuch.
The author’s condensed comments on the text and on some of its problems of interpretation give readers the benefit of his long years of study.
In The Unity of [Isaiah](bk.#Isaiah) (1950)
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) brings his learning and sharpness of intellect to bear on the allegations that the Book of [Isaiah](bk.#Isaiah) is the work of more than one author writing at different times.
A major dividing point between [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) and liberal critics is his frank acceptance of the supernatural.
He firmly believes that prophecy could be truly predictive.  
He accepts the references to [Cyrus](bk.#Cyrus.1) by name in 44:28 and 45:1 as true prophecy written by [Isaiah](bk.#Isaiah) himself.
They are not to be explained as written after [Cyrus](bk.#Cyrus.1)’s birth.
In this book [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) endeavors to speak in [Isaiah](bk.#Isaiah)’s behalf as The Five Books of [Moses](bk.#Moses) did for [Moses](bk.#Moses).
Prophecy and the Church (1945) describes itself on its title page as “an examination of the claim of dispensationalists that the Christian church is a mystery parenthesis which interrupts the fulfilment to Israel of the kingdom prophecies in the Old Testament.”
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis), well aware of the gravity of the critics’ attack on the Bible, recognized how important it is for Christians to stand together against destructive forces from without.
He feared that the dispensationalism of his day was separating Christians and weakening their power to fight unitedly against their real enemies.
In an irenic spirit [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) seeks to show from Scriptures that the dispensationalist construction as summarized on his title page is wrong because it does not recognize the typical and preparatory character of the Old Testament dispensation.
The reaction to the book was divided.
In some quarters it was well received and influential; in others the response was negative.
This divided reception convinced [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) all the more of the vital importance of the subject.
Another area in which [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) drew on his vast learning was the evaluation of modern versions of the Bible.
Ever since 1881, the year in which the New Testament portion of the Revised Version appeared, there had been a ceaseless flow of new translations of the New Testament.
Throughout [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s lifetime at least one new English version or revision of a previous version of the New Testament (or much of it) appeared on the average every year.
(New translations of the whole Bible were also issued, but less frequently.)
This unceasing parade of versions so concerned him that he published various articles and three full-length critiques.
He was greatly desirous that Christians who could not read the Bible in its original languages have a dependable, accurate version in their own language.
He concluded that “some of the new translations, especially those which are described as ‘modern speech’ versions, are paraphrase rather than translation; and with a view to clarifying or simplifying the meaning of the text, they at times introduce into it meanings which are at least questionable.
Sometimes they even change the text to bring out of it a meaning which is not clearly there.”
The Revised Standard Version of the New Testament is given a mixed review: “Considered as a ‘modern speech’ version, the RSV has this in its favor, that it is in general more conservative than its principal competitors.
But it does not differ essentially from them.
It shares their virtues and their defects.
By dealing freely with the text, and substituting interpretive paraphrase for accurate translation, it is able at times to throw light on difficult passages and to produce a more ‘understandable’ and ‘pleasurable’ rendering than AV [the Authorized or [King James Version](bio.kingjamesversion_1)] or RV
[the Revised Version].”  
In addition, [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) declares that it is erroneous to call the Revised Standard Version a revision: “For in RSV the work of revision has been carried to such an extreme that the result is much more a new translation than a revision, and A New Translation is what the Revised Standard Version should be called.”  
The Revised Standard Version of the Old Testament is regarded as even less trustworthy than the New Testament.
It differs radically in diction and style from the Authorized Version.
Indeed, it “is not merely a ‘modern speech’ but a ‘modernist’ or ‘higher critical’ revision of the version of 1611… .
It makes many changes in the text of the Bible, either on the authority of the ancient versions or simply on the basis of conjecture.
And its marginal notes are at times inaccurate, inadequate, and misleading; and they tend quite definitely to undermine confidence in the authority and trustworthiness of the Bible.”
Finally, as for the New Testament portion of the New English Bible, [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) concluded that it is so paraphrastic and interpretative that it is not a faithful translation of the text.
In his valedictory volume, The Old Testament: Its Claims and Its Critics (1972), [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) expresses the convictions, the conclusions, and the loyalties of a lifetime of distinguished service.
It is the witness of a faithful believer to the all-glorious, transcendent [God](bk.#God) of the Bible.
It is basically made up of the Payton Lectures that [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) delivered at Fuller Theological Seminary in 1952, but with substantial enlargement, including the addition of a whole new chapter on chronology.
The chapter headings provide a handy outline of the book: “The Old Testament from Within Its Facts and Its Doctrines”; “The Old Testament from Within Its Literary Form”; “The Old Testament from Without” (i.e., its historical setting and background); “The Old Testament and Its Critics”; “Comparing the Incomparable”; and “Chronology.”
In this book we are reminded of [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s Princeton heritage, of [Wilson](bio.RobertWilson.1)’s address in the opening exercises of 1902, and of the glory of the biblical supernaturalism in which [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) rejoiced.
Here we have a Christian manifesto exalting the perfections of the one, living, and true [God](bk.#God) of the Bible.
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s literary productivity was not limited to the writing of books.
The bibliographical list of his articles, reviews, and pamphlets covers almost eight pages in small print.  
And some of its titles represent a series of articles rather than just one article.
Even in the stressful years when the battle for Princeton Seminary was producing much concern and claiming much time, [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) continued to write on various subjects.
In 1925 he published seven articles, six reviews, and one pamphlet; in 1926, three articles and five reviews; in 1927, two articles and eleven reviews; in 1928, two articles and nine reviews; in 1929, the year of the departure from Princeton and the establishment of Westminster Seminary, three articles and eight reviews.
Covering a variety of subjects, the articles, reviews, and pamphlets are a tribute to the breadth of the author’s competence.
The first article that [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) published was “The Transcendence of [Jehovah](bk.%Yahweh_Deity), [God](bk.#God) of Israel: 44:24–28.”
His bibliographer comments: “It may not be amiss for the bibliographer to note Dr. [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s own judgment that this, his first contribution to biblical studies, was his most important.”  
And [Wilbur Smith](bio.wilbursmith_1) was highly appreciative of a review that required exceptional knowledge of the Bible: “As an illustration of his loyalty to the great basic truths of the Christian faith, one need only call attention to his review some years ago of the second edition (1926) of the Standard Bible Dictionary, extending to over 30,000 words, probably the most important examination of any Bible dictionary in our language published in the last fifty years… .
Not only was Dr. [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) scholastically equipped for this kind of work, but he also was convinced that he had a responsibility to use this knowledge, and his faith in the Word of [God](bk.#God), in warning his generation of the danger of liberal tendencies in Biblical interpretation which result in the undermining of the faith of many.”
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s contribution to Christian literature may already seem overwhelming, but there is more to report.
He served as editor of the Princeton Theological Review from 1918 to 1929.
Paul Woolley, who spent many years as the editor of a similar journal, the Westminster Theological Journal, has much praise for and understanding of [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s achievement as an editor:
A virtue which often goes unsung among the more flashy achievements of life is the quality of long and constant application to an unexciting but vital task.
For many years, amidst very unsatisfactory degrees of support from some of his colleagues, [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) edited for the Princeton faculty the Princeton Theological Review.
It carried on the work that [Charles Hodge](bio.CharlesHodge) had begun with the Biblical Repertory in 1825.
The Review did not cater to the cheap and easy conclusions which might be tempting, but represented solid, effective scholarship.
A product of this character demands a great amount of slogging attention to detail.
No one demonstrates his thanks, but without this painful work the results of more dashing forays into the problems of the field are weakened and, sometimes, nullified.
This is the type of effort upon which [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) spent countless hours.
The brilliant books which he produced have been appreciated on all sides.
But who thinks of the hours devoted to the Review?
21
And in addition to serving as editor of the Review, [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) was also a contributing editor of the original Christianity Today (1938–48) and an associate editor of the Evangelical Quarterly (1929–73).
One further comment about [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s work as a writer.
[Charles Craig](bio.charlescraig_1) of the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, which produced [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s books, reports that the manuscripts submitted by [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) were in virtually impeccable condition: “Editing was superfluous.
Misplaced commas or misspelled words were absent, and even typographical errors were practically non-existent.
Doubtless his years as the distinguished editor of the Princeton Theological Review sharpened this achievement, but the condition of his manuscripts as well as their content reflected his zeal for perfection.” [Craig](bio.charlescraig_1)
[Craig](bio.charlescraig_1) also suggests that [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis)’s wife might have helped in this achievement.
In 1927 [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) had married the talented [Ruth Robinson](bio.ruthrobinson_1) of Princeton.
They were given to hospitality and made delightful hosts, as seminary students could attest.
Two daughters came from their union, [Julia Thompson](bio.juliathompsonseaborg_1), who became the wife of [Walter Olof Seaborg](bio.walterolofseaborg_1), and [Constance Ruth](bio.constanceruthneale_1), who married [J. Milton Neale II](bio.jmiltonnealeii_1).
[Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) died on January 12, 1973, a prince and a great man in Israel.
A volume of Old Testament studies to be dedicated to him was in its final stages of preparation at the time.
In God’s good providence [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) had been shown a copy of the tentative table of contents and the first installment of the galley proofs shortly before he left us for the presence of the Lord.
This volume, The Law and the Prophets, as he surely would have approved, was then dedicated and presented to one who had supported him through the years and who had contributed inexpressibly much to his long and fruitful life Mrs. Oswald Thompson Allis.
Although the tribute intended for [Allis](bio.OswaldAllis) was regrettably late, Hampden-Sydney College as far back as 1927 had appropriately recognized his Christian character and service by bestowing on him a degree that he truly merited, the honorary degree of doctor of divinity.
