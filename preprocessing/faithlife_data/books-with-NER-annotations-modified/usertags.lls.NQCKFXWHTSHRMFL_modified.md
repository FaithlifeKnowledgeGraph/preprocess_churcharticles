Introduction
It is not much of a recommendation when all you can say is that this teaching may help you if you do not take its details too seriously.
It is utterly damning to have to say, as in this case I think we must, that if you do take its details seriously, it will tend not to help you but to destroy you.
That’s what the influential theologian [J. I. Packer](bio.jipacker) wrote about higher life theology.
It has harmed many people including me.

## I TRIED TO “LET GO AND LET [GOD](bk.#God)”

I’m not sure when [God](bk.#God) first enabled me to turn from my sins and trust [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
I probably became a Christian when I was eight or twelve years old.
In my teen years, I deeply desired to be holy.
I wanted to serve [God](bk.#God) with my heart and soul and mind and strength.
I didn’t want to waste my life.
When I shared my Christian “testimony” in my high school and early college years, I would say something like this: “[God](bk.#God) saved me from my sins when I was eight years old, and I surrendered to [Christ](bk.#Christ) when I was thirteen.”
By “saved,” I meant [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) became my Savior, and I became a Christian.
By “surrendered,” I meant I dedicated myself to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) I finally gave full control of my life to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) as my Master and yielded to do whatever he wanted me to do.
Most of the Christians I knew especially preachers used those categories, so I did, too.
Young people in my youth groups or at summer camp commonly told their stories the same way: “I accepted [Christ](bk.#Christ) as my Savior when I was eight years old, and I accepted [Christ](bk.#Christ) as my Lord when I was thirteen.”
That was the standard [God](bk.#God)-talk lingo.
There were always two steps: first you get saved; then you get serious.
Too many of us Christians were saved but not serious.
We were living a lower life rather than a higher life, a shallow life rather than a deeper life, a defeated life rather than a victorious life, a fruitless life rather than a more abundant life.
We were “carnal,” not “spiritual.”
We experienced the first blessing but still needed the second blessing.
[Jesus](bk.#Jesus) was our Savior, but he still wasn’t our Master.
So preachers urged us to make [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) our Master.
How?
Through surrender and faith: “Let go and let [God](bk.#God).”
The small Bible college I attended as an undergraduate was a ministry of my church, and preachers in my college and church took this carnal-spiritual dichotomy to another level.
It became their primary focus and distinctive passion.
Whether the text was from Exodus, Jeremiah, Matthew, or Revelation, nearly every sermon had the same application to Christians: Be Spirit-filled.
That’s the key.
At first, I genuinely tried to go along with the program, but it just didn’t work for me.
During my freshman and sophomore years of college, I became frustrated, then disillusioned, and then suspicious.
I became frustrated because I still struggled with sin.
I became disillusioned because higher life theology seemed too good to be true.
And I became suspicious because this teaching didn’t seem to fit with what I was reading in the Bible.
I appealed to one of my former pastors for guidance, and he guided me safely through this storm.
He recommended books, articles, sermons, and syllabi from his seminary, and I devoured them.
By the time I was a senior in college, my school’s president and vice president nearly expelled me for not embracing their two-tiered view of Christian living.

## EVALUATING HIGHER LIFE THEOLOGY

I entered graduate school with this issue on my front burner.
I wanted to go deeper, so I wrote several research papers related to the topic as I completed an MA in [Bible](bk.%Bible_Writing) and then worked on a PhD in [theology](bk.%theology).
I met more and more people who were victims of higher life theology, and I became aware of even more people who continued to propagate it.
So when it came time to choose a dissertation topic, I decided to evaluate higher life [theology](bk.%theology).
I wrote a dissertation that surveys the [history](bk.%history) and [theology](bk.%theology) of that two-tiered view of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) and then analyzes it.
Then I lightly revised that dissertation as a book for Lexham Press: Let Go and Let [God](bk.#God)?
A Survey and Analysis of Keswick Theology.
This book is a miniature version of my more detailed and academic work Let Go and Let [God](bk.#God)?
I have stripped out most of the academic jargon and repackaged it to make it more inviting for thoughtful lay people.
For example, I usually use the term higher life theology instead of [Keswick theology](bk.%KeswickTheology_Belief) since higher life theology is a more intuitive label.
I also want to be careful to distinguish higher life theology from the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) today.
(By the way, Keswick is pronounced KEH-zick.
The w is silent.)
I have become more and more convinced that the “let go and let [God](bk.#God)” approach to Christian living is a quick fix.
A quick fix, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is “a quick and easy remedy or solution” or negatively, “an expedient but temporary solution which fails to address underlying problems.”
That’s what I think higher life theology is an easy but temporary remedy or solution that fails to address underlying problems.
And that’s why the title of this book is No Quick Fix.

## WHY IS HIGHER LIFE THEOLOGY SO POPULAR?

My story is not unique.
Hundreds of Christians have shared their stories with me about how higher life theology has harmed them.
I have tried to do my part to drive a nail in the coffin of higher life theology, but higher life theology is by no means dead.
So if higher life theology is so harmful, why is it so popular?
It is pervasive because countless people have propagated it in so many ways, especially in sermons and devotional writings.
It is appealing because Christians struggle with sin and want to be victorious in that struggle now.
Higher life theology offers a quick fix to this struggle, and its shortcut to instant victory appeals to people who genuinely desire to be holy.

## WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?

This book is for you if you have a form of higher life theology in your background.
You may embrace higher life theology enthusiastically; you may embrace it unknowingly; you may know there’s something not right about it but can’t clearly explain why; or you may reject it and would like to analyze it more penetratingly.
This book is also for you if you don’t have a form of higher life theology in your background.
Higher life theology is so widespread that you will be able to serve your brothers and sisters in [Christ](bk.#Christ) better if you understand what it is and why it’s dangerous.
A silver lining of theological controversy is that it can help you refine how you understand what the Bible teaches.
In this case, analyzing higher life theology will help you better understand the Christian life.

## HOW THIS BOOK EVALUATES HIGHER LIFE THEOLOGY

This book has two parts.
Part 1 tells the story of higher life theology (chap.

1.  and explains what it is (chap.
    2).
    Part 2 evaluates whether higher life theology agrees with the Bible (chaps.
    3–4).
    My goal is not to make you an arrogant know-it-all who pugnaciously goes on higher life theology witch hunts.
    My goal is to edify you by warning and equipping you.
    I’ll consider this book a success if it helps you understand higher life theology better so that you follow a more biblical way in your Christian walk (see the appendix).
    There is no quick fix.

# PART 1: Where Higher Life Theology Came From and What It Is

    Before we can responsibly evaluate higher life theology (part 2), we must understand it.
    We must listen before we critique.
    So part 1 tells the story of where higher life theology came from (chap.

1.  and explains what exactly it is (chap.
    2). ## CHAPTER 1: What Is the Story of Higher Life Theology?
    When I first heard people preach and teach higher life theology, I didn’t know anything about its story.
    My pastors and other teachers claimed the Bible teaches higher life theology, so I initially assumed that they were right and that Christians have always embraced it.
    Learning its history was a liberating step for me.
    I realized that this view is novel that it is relatively new in the history of Christianity.
    It is also just one of several competing views about Christian living.
    There are at least five major views that evangelicals hold on the Christian life.
    At the risk of oversimplifying them, five figures presented throughout this book attempt to graphically depict those views of Christian living, which theologians call views of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) (see figs.
    1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2.4, and 3.8).
    This chapter tells the story of higher life theology by answering three main questions:

1)  Where did higher life theology come from?
2)  Who initially popularized higher life theology?
3)  What are some influential variations on higher life theology?
    The story begins with [John Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1).
4)  WHERE DID HIGHER LIFE THEOLOGY COME FROM?
    Figure 1.1 illustrates where higher life theology came from:
    Fig.
    1.1.

## Where Did Higher Life Theology Come From?

Higher life theology has two main influences: Wesleyan [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) and the [holiness](bk.pt:Holiness) movement.

### WESLEYAN [Perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief): PERFECT LOVE TOWARD [God](bk.#God) AND HUMANS

The Wesleyan view of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) has a lot in common with higher life theology.
[John Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1) (1703–1791) is the father of views that chronologically separate the time a person becomes a Christian from the time [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) begins.
[Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1) taught “[Christian perfection](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief),” which he qualifies does not refer to absolute sinless perfection.
Christian perfection is a type of perfection that only Christians can experience as opposed to Adamic perfection, angelic perfection, or [God](bk.#God)’s unique, absolute perfection.
The way [Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1) qualifies Christian perfection hinges on how he narrowly defines sin as “a voluntary transgression of a known law.”
He limits “sin” to only intentional sinful acts.
He admits that “the best of men” commit “involuntary transgressions,” for which they need [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s atonement, but he can still call such people perfect or sinless.
When one defines sin that way, [Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1) does not object to the term “sinless perfection,” but he refrains from using that term because it is misleading.
The essence of [Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1)’s Christian perfection is perfectly loving [God](bk.#God) with your whole being and, consequently, perfectly loving fellow humans.
Christian perfection occurs at a point in time after you are already a Christian.
[Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1) labels this second work of grace as not only Christian perfection but salvation from all sin, entire [sanctification](bk.%sanctification), perfect love, holiness, purity of intention, full salvation, second blessing, second rest, and dedicating all your life to [God](bk.#God) (see fig.
1.2).
Fig.
1.2.
The Wesleyan View of [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification)
Two of [Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1)’s followers significantly developed his doctrine of Christian perfection.
[John Fletcher](bio.johnfletcher_1) (1729–1785) used “Pentecostal” language to describe how Christian [perfection](bk.%perfection) begins the instant a believer experiences the outpouring of the Spirit, is [baptized with the Spirit](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit), is [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit), or receives the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) as the promise from the Father.
[Adam Clarke](bio.adamclarke1) (1762–1832) used [Fletcher](bio.JohnFletcher)’s “Pentecostal” language to emphasize the crisis of Christian perfection more than both [Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1) and[ Fletcher](bio.JohnFletcher).

### THE HOLINESS MOVEMENT: MODIFIED WESLEYAN [Perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief)

When Wesleyan [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) blended with American revivalism, the holiness movement emerged.
The holiness movement began in the late 1830s and modified the views of [Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1), [Fletcher](bio.JohnFletcher), and [Clarke](bio.adamclarke1).
Two significant parts of the holiness movement were Methodist [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) and Oberlin [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief).
Methodist [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) emphasized the crisis of Christian perfection more emphatically than [Wesleyan](bk.%Methodism_Belief) [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief).
The person most responsible for that was [Phoebe Palmer](bio.PhoebePalmer) (1807–1874).
Her “altar theology” promised “a shorter way” to holiness.
The term altar theology comes from the first step of [Palmer](bio.PhoebePalmer)’s popular three-step teaching: You must entirely consecrate yourself or totally surrender by offering yourself and all you have on the altar ( 12:1–2).
[Christ](bk.#Christ) is the altar ( 29:37; 13:10), and the altar sanctifies the offering ( 23:19).
When you entirely consecrate yourself, you are instantly and entirely sanctified.
[Palmer](bio.PhoebePalmer) used “Pentecostal” language to emphasize the crisis of Christian perfection, which she argued results in power for serving [God](bk.#God).
Her views became popular through her writings and through holiness camp meetings that began in [New Jersey](bk.%NewJersey_Place) in 1867.
During these holiness camp meetings, revivalists pressed people to choose to experience the crisis of entire [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
Oberlin [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) is similar to Wesleyan [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief), but it distinctively views [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) as entirely consecrating a person’s autonomous free will to obey the moral law.
Its two main proponents were [Charles Finney](bio.CharlesFinney) (1792–1875) and [Asa Mahan](bio.asamahan_1) (1799–1889).
They taught that Christian perfection begins with a crisis of [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) that Christians should experience at a point in time after they first become Christians.
[Finney](bio.CharlesFinney) embraced [Pelagianism](bk.%Pelagianism_Belief), which denies that humans are totally depraved and views them as able to obey any of [God](bk.#God)’s commands without [God](bk.#God)’s help.
The preacher’s task is to persuade their autonomous free will to obey.
Under the heading “Entire Sanctification Is Attainable in This Life,” [Finney](bio.CharlesFinney) asserts, “It is self-evident that entire obedience to [God](bk.#God)’s law is possible on the ground of natural ability.”
[Mahan](bio.asamahan_1) names two doctrines as the theme of his life: Christian perfection and the baptism of the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit).
He emphasized that unbelievers benefit from justification at conversion and that believers benefit from [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) sometime after conversion when they are Spirit-baptized.
[Mahan](bio.asamahan_1) had both theological affinities and personal connections with both Methodist [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) and higher life theology.
He endorsed [Phoebe Palmer](bio.PhoebePalmer)’s The Way of Holiness, and the Palmers published his The Baptism of the Holy Ghost (1870).
After he moved to [England](bk.@England) in 1872, he helped lead the higher life movement, which immediately preceded the first [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) in 1875.

## 2. WHO INITIALLY POPULARIZED HIGHER LIFE THEOLOGY?

Higher life theology includes the higher life movement (1858–1875) and culminated in the early Keswick movement (1875–1920).
Both movements represented a number of different Christian denominations rather than just one.
Higher life theology modified Wesleyan, Methodist, and Oberlin [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) in a way that appealed more broadly to non-Methodists: it referred to the higher Christian life instead of Christian perfection.

## THE HIGHER LIFE MOVEMENT

The higher life movement began in 1858 when [William Boardman](bio.williamboardman)’s popular book The Higher Christian Life released, and it dissolved in 1875 when its leaders removed [Robert Pearsall Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) from public ministry.
[William E. Boardman](bio.williamboardman) (1810–1886).
[Phoebe Palmer](bio.PhoebePalmer), [Charles Finney](bio.CharlesFinney), and [Asa Mahan](bio.asamahan_1) strongly influenced how [Boardman](bio.williamboardman) understood the Christian life.
[Boardman](bio.williamboardman) professed that [God](bk.#God) justified him when he was eighteen and sanctified him when he was thirty-two.
The essence of the higher Christian life is separating justification from [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
[Boardman](bio.williamboardman) equated [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) with the “second conversion,” and his best-known book, The Higher Christian Life, sold over 100,000 copies in less than thirty years.
He began and led the higher life movement for over a decade until a husband-wife team [Robert](bio.robertpsmith_1) and [Hannah Smith](bio.hannahwhitallsmith) overshadowed him in the early 1870s.
[Robert Pearsall Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) (1827–1898) and [Hannah Whitall Smith](bio.hannahwhitallsmith) (1832–1911).
[Robert](bio.robertpsmith_1) and [Hannah Smith](bio.hannahwhitallsmith) zealously spread their crisis experiences with others through personal conversations, public speaking, and most enduringly through [Hannah](bio.hannahwhitallsmith)’s writing.
The message of her most influential book, The Christian’s Secret of a Happy Life, is essentially two steps: 3. “entire surrender” or “entire abandonment” (i.e., “let go”) 4. “absolute faith” (i.e., “let [God](bk.#God)”)
As with [Boardman](bio.williamboardman), foundational to her message is separating [justification](bk.pt:Justification) (i.e., [God](bk.#God)’s declaring a believing sinner righteous) and [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) (i.e., Christian growth in holiness), which explains why she would appeal to “carnal” Christians to surrender to the Lord, who “is able to save you fully, now, in this life, from the power and dominion of sin.”
Only some believers experience this crisis (which she identifies with [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit)).
She explains,
This new life I had entered upon has been called by several different names.
The Methodists called it “The Second Blessing,” or “The Blessing of [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification);” the Presbyterians called it “The Higher Life,” or “The Life of Faith;” the Friends called it “The Life hid with [Christ](bk.#Christ) in [God](bk.#God).”
But by whatever name it may be called, the truth at the bottom of each name is the same, and can be expressed in four little words, “Not I, but [Christ](bk.#Christ).”
Although The Christian’s Secret of a Happy Life endures as a devotional “classic,” [Robert](bio.robertpsmith_1) and [Hannah Smith](bio.hannahwhitallsmith) did not have “happy” lives.
The [Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) family experienced a series of sad events: (1)
At the height of his success as a higher life revivalist, [Robert](bio.robertpsmith_1) fell doctrinally and morally.
(2) [Robert](bio.robertpsmith_1) and [Hannah](bio.hannahwhitallsmith)’s deteriorating marriage declined even further.
[Hannah](bio.hannahwhitallsmith)’s intense feminism and independence, Robert’s manic-depressive nature, and [Robert](bio.robertpsmith_1)’s persistence in unrepentant adultery all contributed to a very unhappy marriage.
(3) [Robert](bio.robertpsmith_1) apostatized and became an agnostic.
(4) [Hannah](bio.hannahwhitallsmith) apostatized.
She lost interest in the higher life, rejoined the [Quakers](bk.%SocietyOfFriends) in 1886, and embraced universalism and religious pluralism.
While the [Smiths](bio.robertpsmith_1) were popular writers on their own, what “institutionalized the message of the [Smiths](bio.hannahwhitallsmith)” was the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People).

### THE EARLY KESWICK MOVEMENT

The higher life theology of [Boardman](bio.williamboardman) and the [Smiths](bio.robertpsmith_1) captivated [T. D. Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person).
Through a sermon that [Evan Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) preached on 4:46–50 at a meeting that [Robert Pearsall Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) led in 1874, [Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person) experienced his crisis on September 1, 1874.
[Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) distinguished between the nobleman’s “seeking faith” and “resting faith” in 4:46–50, and [Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person) pointed to this as the moment when his “seeking faith” became a “resting faith.”
[Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person) and [Robert Wilson](bio.robertwilson) decided to hold a similar meeting in their hometown of Keswick, a small town in northwest [England](bk.@England).
They asked [Robert Pearsall Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) to chair their meeting, but [Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) fell from ministry just a few days before the first [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) began in 1875.
Keswick has hosted the week-long [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) each July since 1875.
Dozens of people preached and taught at the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) in its first generation (1875–1920), and all of them experienced a crisis in which they entered “the rest of faith.”
What follows highlights sixteen of higher life theology’s most noteworthy and influential proponents.
The first eight were convention leaders.
1–2.
[T. D. Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person) (1823–1883) and [Robert Wilson](bio.robertwilson) (1824–1905): Keswick’s Founders.
[Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person) and [Wilson](bio.robertwilson) cofounded the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) in 1875.
[Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person) chaired the Keswick meetings from 1875 until he died in 1883, and [Wilson](bio.robertwilson), later Keswick’s third chairman, handled logistical details. 5. [J. Elder Cumming](bio.jeldercumming) (1830–1917): Keswick’s Exemplar.
[Cumming](bio.jameseldercumming_1) was a minister with a reputation for being irritable.
When he first visited the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) in 1882, on two separate occasions some ladies who knew him expressed that they were delightfully surprised to see him there, implying that he needed what Keswick had to offer.
He experienced his crisis that week and returned to speak at Keswick for the next twenty-four consecutive years until 1906.
The revivalist [D. L. Moody](bio.DwightMoody) knew [Cumming](bio.jameseldercumming_1) before his crisis in 1882 and considered him the “most cantankerous Christian
[he] had ever met.”
When [Moody](bio.DwightMoody) visited [Cumming](bio.jameseldercumming_1) in 1891, he remarked in disbelief, “Whatever has happened to [Cumming](bio.jameseldercumming_1)?
I have never seen a man so altered, so full of the love of [God](bk.#God).”
When Moody learned that [Cumming](bio.jameseldercumming_1) had been to Keswick, he replied, “Then I only wish all other Christians would go to Keswick too, and get their hearts filled with the love of [God](bk.#God).” 6. [Evan H. Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) (1837–1918): Keswick’s Formative Theologian.
[Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) experienced his higher life crisis of surrender and faith in 1873 when [Robert Pearsall Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) and [William Boardman](bio.williamboardman) were informally speaking on the higher Christian life throughout [England](bk.@England).
A few years later it was [Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) who was preaching when [Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person) entered the “rest of faith” and then founded the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People).
[Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) did not attend the first [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) because, as a member of the council of eight who dismissed [Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) after his fall, [Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) was occupied with replacing [Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) as the new editor of The Christian’s Pathway to Power (which he changed to The Life of Faith).
But he appeared as a leader at the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) for the next forty consecutive years (1876–1915).
He was perhaps the single most respected and influential early Keswick leader, and he was Keswick’s most formative theologian. 7. [H. W. Webb-Peploe](bio.hwwebbpeploe_1) (1837–1923): Keswick’s Orator.
[Webb-Peploe](bio.hwwebbpeploe_1), an Anglican clergyman, experienced his higher life crisis in 1874, and he spoke at twenty-eight [Keswick Conventions](bk.%KeswickConvention_People).
He was a popular speaker and perhaps Keswick’s finest orator. 8. [H. C. G. Moule](bio.HendleyMoule) (1841–1920): Keswick’s Scholar.
[Moule](bio.HendleyMoule) is the most prestigious scholar associated with the early Keswick movement.
He was the principal of Ridley Hall in Cambridge (1880–1899) and the Bishop of Durham (1901–1920), and he wrote popular commentaries on Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.
He initially viewed the Keswick movement unfavorably: in 1884 he negatively reviewed [Evan Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1)’s The Law of Liberty in the Spiritual Life.
But later that year he experienced his crisis of surrender and faith after listening to [Evan Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) preach.
[Moule](bio.HendleyMoule) spoke at the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) thirteen times between 1886 and 1919. 9. [F. B. Meyer](bio.FrederickMeyer) (1847–1929): Keswick’s International Ambassador.
[Meyer](bio.FrederickMeyer) experienced his first crisis in 1884 and a second in 1887, illustrating the three steps he proclaimed that people should experience: (1) conversion, (2) consecration, and (3) the [anointing of the Spirit](bk.%anointing).
He spoke at the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) twenty-six times, and as one of the world’s most popular preachers, he was the worldwide spokesman for higher life theology.
He authored over seventy popular books and booklets, and he helped spread higher life theology to America through [D. L. Moody](bio.DwightMoody)’s annual [Northfield](bk.@NorthfieldMassachusetts) in [Massachusetts](bk.@Massachusetts). 10. [Charles A. Fox](bio.charlesafox_1) (1836–1900): Keswick’s Poet.
Frequent illnesses prevented [Fox](bio.charlesafox_1) from speaking at the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) until 1879, after which he spoke every year through 1899 (except 1897).
After his first convention, he gave the closing address on the final evening of each convention he attended.
He was Keswick’s poet, and his best-known poem was “The Marred Face.”
The next eight people were not as prominent and regular speakers at the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) as the eight above, but they were highly influential in spreading higher life theology. 11. [Andrew Murray](bio.AndrewMurray.1) (1828–1917): Keswick’s Foremost Devotional Author.
[Murray](bio.AndrewMurray.1) popularized higher life theology in [South Africa](bk.%SouthAfrica_Place).
He attended the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) as a listener in 1882 and a speaker in 1895, when as a prolific author he was by far the most popular speaker.
He authored over 250 devotional books.
10–11.
[J. Hudson Taylor](bio.hudsonjtaylor) (1832–1905) and [Amy Carmichael](bio.AmyCarmichael) (1867–1951): Keswick’s Foremost Missionaries.
The [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) began to focus on both consecration and missions beginning in 1886–1887.
[Taylor](bio.hudsonjtaylor), founder of the [China](bk.%China_Place), estimated that Keswick produced two-thirds of his missionaries.
He experienced the higher life on September 4, 1869, after he read this phrase in a letter from a fellow missionary: “Not by striving after faith, but by resting on the Faithful One.”
[Taylor](bio.hudsonjtaylor) visited Keswick in 1883 and 1887 and officially spoke in 1893.
The first missionary whom the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) supported was [Amy Carmichael](bio.AmyCarmichael), the adopted daughter of Keswick’s cofounder [Robert Wilson](bio.robertwilson).
She served in [Japan](bk.%Japan_Place) for one year and in [India](bk.@India) for fifty-six, and she wrote over thirty-five books. 12. [Frances Ridley Havergal](bio.FrancisHavergal) (1836–1879): Keswick’s Hymnist.
After experiencing her crisis on December 2, 1873, [Havergal](bio.FrancisHavergal) became known as “the consecration poet,” and she “thus was able before her early death to write those hymnal lyrics indelibly identified with Keswick: Like a river glorious is [God](bk.#God)’s perfect peace [1878] and Take my Life and let it be [1874].” 13. [A. T. Pierson](bio.arthurtpierson) (1837–1911): Keswick’s American Ambassador.
[Pierson](bio.arthurtpierson) did not experience his higher life crisis that identified him with the Keswick movement until 1895.
He spoke at eight [Keswick Conventions](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) from 1897 to 1909, and he promoted [Keswick theology](bk.%KeswickTheology_Belief) in his writing and preaching, spreading it at key conferences, such as [Northfield](bk.%NorthfieldBibleConference) in America.
14–16.
[W. H. Griffith Thomas](bio.WHGriffithThomas) (1861–1924), [Charles G. Trumbull](bio.charlesgtrumbull_1) (1872–1941), and [Robert C. McQuilkin](bio.robertcrawfordmcquilkin_1) (1886–1952): Keswick’s Leaders of the Victorious Life Movement.
The victorious life movement was the American version of the Keswick movement (although it was not officially connected with the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People)).
It began in 1913 and promoted higher life theology for decades.
Its three primary leaders were [Griffith Thomas](bio.WHGriffithThomas), [Trumbull](bio.charlesgallaudettrumbull), and [McQuilkin](bio.robertcrawfordmcquilkin_1).
[Griffith Thomas](bio.WHGriffithThomas) experienced his crisis at age eighteen, and he spoke at the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) four times (1906–1908, 1914).
He was the featured speaker at the first victorious life conference in 1913.
[Trumbull](bio.charlesgallaudettrumbull) experienced his crisis in 1910 and enthusiastically promoted higher life theology in America.
[McQuilkin](bio.robertcrawfordmcquilkin_1) experienced his crisis on August 15, 1911, when [Trumbull](bio.charlesgallaudettrumbull) counseled him in a conference center’s prayer room.
He was [Trumbull](bio.charlesgallaudettrumbull)’s right-hand man until [McQuilkin](bio.robertcrawfordmcquilkin_1) became the founder and president of Columbia Bible School in 1923.

## 3. WHAT ARE SOME INFLUENTIAL VARIATIONS ON HIGHER LIFE THEOLOGY?

Higher life theology spawned four institutions or movements that have greatly influenced American [evangelicalism](bk.%Evangelicalism_Belief): the [Christian and Missionary Alliance](bk.%ChristianMissionaryAlliance_Denom), [Moody Bible Institute](bk.%MoodyBibleInstitute), [Pentecostalism](bk.%Pentecostal_Belief), and Dallas Theological Seminary.
Those four successors to higher life theology each began as influential variations on higher life theology (emphasis on began as today the [Christian and Missionary Alliance](bk.%ChristianMissionaryAlliance_Denom), Moody Bible Institute, and Dallas Theological Seminary do not promote higher life theology like they used to).

### THE CHRISTIAN AND MISSIONARY ALLIANCE: FOUNDED BY [A. B. Simpson](bio.absimpson)

[A. B. Simpson](bio.absimpson) (1844–1919) founded two nondenominational mission agencies in 1887 that merged in 1897 as the [Christian and Missionary Alliance](bk.%ChristianMissionaryAlliance_Denom).
It was not technically part of the higher life movement but was sympathetic with it.
[Simpson](bio.absimpson), who authored over one hundred books, experienced his higher life crisis in 1874 when reading [Boardman](bio.williamboardman)’s The Higher Christian Life.
His view of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) was similar but not identical to the Wesleyan and Keswick views.
He viewed [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) as the [Christ](bk.#Christ)-filled life, which begins at a crisis that occurs at a point in time after one has already become a Christian.
At this crisis, a Christian is filled or baptized with the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit).
But unlike Pentecostalism, [Simpson](bio.absimpson) did not believe that speaking in tongues is an evidence of that crisis.

### MOODY BIBLE INSTITUTE: LED BY [D. L. Moody](bio.DwightMoody), [R. A. Torrey](bio.rtorrey), AND [James M. Gray](bio.JamesMartinGray)

Moody Bible Institute began in 1889 as the Bible Institute for Home and Foreign Missions of the [Chicago](bk.@Chicago) Evangelization Society.
In March 1900 (after [Moody](bio.DwightMoody)’s death in December 1899), its name changed to Moody Bible Institute.
It emphasized practical Christian ministry, and it became an internationally influential force in [evangelicalism](bk.%Evangelicalism_Belief) through its faculty, graduates, and ministries such as Moody Press.
Moody Bible Institute’s first three leaders enthusiastically spread elements of higher life theology. 15. [D. L. Moody](bio.DwightMoody) (1837–1899) emphasized that Christians must experience a crisis of [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) after their conversion.
He testified that he received the baptism of the Spirit just after the great [Chicago](bk.@Chicago) fire in 1871 while walking on Wall Street in [New York City](bk.@NewYorkCity).
Although [Moody](bio.DwightMoody) never entirely or exclusively embraced higher life theology, he was publicly sympathetic with it and allowed it to spread at his popular [Northfield Conferences](bk.%NorthfieldBibleConference).
He passionately emphasized that Christians should be baptized with the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) in order to have power to serve [God](bk.#God) and others.
Other leaders who followed Moody by emphasizing [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) or [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) as the key for “power for service” include [A. J. Gordon](bio.AdoniramGordon), [A. T. Pierson](bio.arthurtpierson), [C. I. Scofield](bio.ciscofield), [R. A. Torrey](bio.rtorrey), and [James M. Gray](bio.JamesMartinGray). 16. [R. A. Torrey](bio.rtorrey) (1856–1928) was superintendent of Moody Bible Institute (1889–1908) and laid the foundation for its curriculum.
He was one of [Moody](bio.DwightMoody)’s closest friends and pastored Chicago Avenue Church (1894–1906), which the church renamed Moody Church in 1908.
[Torrey](bio.rtorrey) shared speaking platforms in America with many Keswick speakers, such as [F. B. Meyer](bio.fbmeyer_2), and he spoke at the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) in 1904 on his most passionate subject: how to receive the baptism of the Spirit.
[Torrey](bio.rtorrey) further accented what Moody emphasized: [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) is a crisis that occurs after a person is already a Christian, and it results in power for service.
Early Pentecostal literature quotes [Torrey](bio.rtorrey) more frequently than it quotes any other non-Pentecostal. 17. [James M. Gray](bio.JamesMartinGray) (1851–1935) began lecturing at Moody Bible Institute in 1892 and remained there until his death.
He served as dean (1904–1923), president (1923–1934), and president emeritus.
He was sympathetic with [Moody](bio.DwightMoody) and [Torrey](bio.rtorrey)’s view of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification), but he did not view [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) as a separate experience that occurs after conversion.
He emphasized [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) as the secret key to victorious living and Spirit-anointing as the means for power in service.

### PENTECOSTALISM: A PRODUCT OF WESLEYAN [Perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief), THE HOLINESS MOVEMENT, HIGHER LIFE THEOLOGY, [A. B. Simpson](bio.absimpson), [D. L. Moody](bio.DwightMoody), AND [R. A. Torrey](bio.rtorrey)

[Pentecostalism](bk.%Pentecostal_Belief), according to most church historians, began on December 31, 1900.
[Charles Fox Parham](bio.CharlesFParham) (1873–1929), a teacher at Bethel Bible School in [Topeka, Kansas](bk.@TopekaKansas), laid his hands on Miss [Agnes Ozman](bio.agnesozman_1) that day, and she soon began [speaking in tongues](bk.%giftOfTongues).
Within days, [Parham](bio.CharlesFParham) and many other students also experienced what they believed was the initial evidence of [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit).
[Pentecostalism](bk.%Pentecostal_Belief) maintains that believers should experience [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) after conversion and initially demonstrate this by speaking in [tongues](bk.pt:Tongues).
Pentecostals are divided regarding whether [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) happens at the [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) crisis or at a later time.
Thus, some call [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) “the second blessing” (see fig.
2.3) and others “the third blessing.”
The three blessings are (1) the crisis of conversion for salvation, (2) the crisis of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) for holiness, and (3) the crisis of [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) for power in service (see fig.
1.3).
Pentecostalism’s roots include Wesleyan [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) ([Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1), [Fletcher](bio.JohnFletcher), and [Clarke](bio.adamclarke1)), Methodist [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) ([Palmer](bio.PhoebePalmer) and the camp meetings), Oberlin [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) ([Finney](bio.finneyjohn_1) and [Mahan](bio.asamahan_1)), the higher life movement ([Boardman](bio.williamboardman) and the [Smiths](bio.robertpaynesmith)), the early Keswick movement (especially [F. B. Meyer](bio.fbmeyer_2), [Andrew Murray](bio.AndrewMurray.1), [A. T. Pierson](bio.arthurtpierson), and [A. J. Gordon](bio.AdoniramGordon)), and the theology of [A. B. Simpson](bio.absimpson), [D. L. Moody](bio.DwightMoody), and [R. A. Torrey](bio.rtorrey).
Common to all these leaders and movements is affirming two distinct crisis events one for conversion and one for a special [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
Higher life theology played a crucial role in forming [Pentecostalism](bk.%Pentecostal_Belief), which subsequently dwarfed higher life theology in size and influence.

The [Pentecostal](bk.%Pentecostal_Belief) View of [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification)

### DALLAS THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY: BASTION OF THE CHAFERIAN VIEW OF [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification)

The higher life and Chaferian views of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) are similar but not identical.
The higher life view predated and highly influenced the Chaferian view, named after [Lewis Sperry Chafer](bio.LewisChafer), who cofounded Dallas Theological Seminary in 1924.
Dallas Theological Seminary is probably the most influential factor for the prevalence of a Keswick-like view of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) in modern [evangelicalism](bk.%Evangelicalism_Belief).
Three theologians have been most influential: 18. [Lewis Sperry Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) (1871–1952) was the protégé of [C. I. Scofield](bio.ciscofield) (1843–1921).
After [Scofield](bio.ciscofield) died, his former church in Dallas called [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) to pastor them; [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) accepted, and the church changed its name to [Scofield](bio.ciscofield) Memorial Church.
You cannot understand [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) apart from [Scofield](bio.ciscofield).
[Scofield](bio.ciscofield) embraced higher life theology, and his famous [Scofield](bio.ciscofield) “more or less canonized Keswick teachings.”
Believers are in one of two distinct categories: (1) those who are not Spirit-filled and (2) those who are Spirit-filled.
The first are powerless, and the second are powerful.
But unlike [Moody](bio.DwightMoody), [Torrey](bio.rtorrey), and [Meyer](bio.fbmeyer_2), he insisted that [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) occurs at conversion for all Christians.
In 1924, [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) cofounded Dallas Theological Seminary (called Evangelical Theological College until 1936).
He cofounded it with [W. H. Griffith Thomas](bio.WHGriffithThomas), one of the early Keswick movement’s leaders.
For the previous decade, [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) had been contemplating the need for a seminary sympathetic with the Bible conference movement’s teaching, especially higher life theology.
Although [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) had earned no formal theological degrees, he served as both the school’s president and professor of systematic theology from 1924 until his death in 1952.
At the beginning of each school year, [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) presented a series of lectures on consecration as the prerequisite for the seminarians to be effective in their studies.
He also taught a course on this subject entitled “Realization of the Spiritual Life” as part of the theological curriculum for first-year students.
His lectures promoted higher life theology, and the essence of his lectures is in his book
He That Is Spiritual, which “became popularly known as Victorious Life Teaching or [Keswick Theology](bk.%KeswickTheology_Belief).”
He opens his book by delineating three distinct categories into which all humans fall: 19. natural (unconverted) 20. carnal (converted but characterized by an unconverted lifestyle) 21. spiritual (converted and Spirit-filled)
People may experience “two great spiritual changes” “the change from the ‘natural’ man to the saved man, and the change from the ‘carnal’ man to the ‘spiritual’ man.”
“By various terms the Bible teaches that there are two classes of Christians.”
Figure 1.4 records [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer)’s contrasts verbatim, and figure 1.5 depicts the Chaferian view of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
Fig.

[Chafer](bio.LewisChafer)’s Two Categories of Christians: Carnal and Spiritual
Category 1: Carnal
Category 2: Spiritual
Those who “abide not”
Those who “abide in [Christ](bk.#Christ)”
Those who “walk in darkness”
Those who are “walking in the light”
Those who “walk as men”
Those who “walk by the Spirit”
Those who “walk after the flesh”
Those who “walk in newness of life”
Those who have the Spirit “in” them, but not “upon” them
Those who have the Spirit “in” and “upon” them
Those who are “carnal”
Those who are “spiritual”
Those who are not [“[filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)”]
Those who are “[filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)”
Fig. 1.5.
The Chaferian View of [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification) 22. [John F. Walvoord](bio.johnwalvoord) (1910–2002) served in leadership roles at Dallas Theological Seminary from 1935 until his death.
He perpetuated [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer)’s Keswick-like view of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
Carnal believers must surrender “once and for all” by accepting [Christ](bk.#Christ) “as Lord,” resulting in the start of “progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).”
He agrees with the Keswick perspective in Five Views on Sanctification, but qualifies that the only point that could use more clarity is to distinguish [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) as a once-for-all-time act at conversion and [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) as the secret “means of transforming the Christian life.” 23. [Charles C. Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie) (1925–2016) “dedicated” his life to [God](bk.#God) after he met with [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) on April 23, 1943.
He later taught systematic theology at Dallas Theological Seminary (1953–1958), served as president of the Philadelphia College of the Bible (1958–1962), and returned to Dallas Theological Seminary to serve as chair of the systematic theology department and dean of doctoral studies until he retired (1962–1983).
Like [Walvoord](bio.johnwalvoord), [Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie) promoted a Keswick-like view of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) by emphasizing “dedication,” a once-for-all-time crisis that is never repeated and transitions believers from being carnal to spiritual.
He views the “Let go and let [God](bk.#God)” slogan as a quietistic, improper emphasis for the Christian life in general because “in the matter of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) there is a part that the believer plays which he very definitely must not let go of.”
But the slogan “is a perfectly proper emphasis when it concerns the matter of dedication.”
[Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie) contrasts [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) with [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) in seven ways (see fig.
1.6).
Fig.
1.6.
[Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie)’s Contrast between [Spirit-Baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) and [Spirit-Filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)
[Baptism [of the Spirit]](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit)
[Filling [of the Spirit]](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)
Occurs only once in each believer’s life

Occurred in the Old Testament
True of all believers

Results in POWER
Occurs when we believe in [Christ](bk.#Christ)
Occurs throughout the Christian life
No prerequisite (except faith in [Christ](bk.#Christ))
Depends on yieldedness
The Chaferian view of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is directly related to the so-called [Lordship salvation controversy](bk.%LordshipSalvationControversy).
The controversy in 1919 between [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) (Chaferian) and [Warfield](bio.BenjaminWarfield) (Reformed) repeated itself in the 1950s with [Steven Barabas](bio.stevenbarabas_1) (Keswick) and [John Murray](bio.JohnMurray) (Reformed) and again in the late 1980s and the 1990s with [Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie) (Chaferian) and [John MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur) (Reformed).
[Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie)’s chapter “Must [Christ](bk.#Christ) Be Lord to Be Savior?” answers the question with a dogmatic No:
The importance of this question cannot be overestimated in relation to both salvation and [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
The message of faith only and the message of faith plus commitment of life cannot both be the gospel; therefore, one of them is a false gospel and comes under the curse of perverting the gospel or preaching another gospel ( 1:6–9), and this is a very serious matter.
As far as [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is concerned, if only committed people are saved people, then where is there room for carnal Christians?
The controversy erupted again in 1988 with [MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur)’s The Gospel according to Jesus.
[Zane Hodges](bio.zanechodges) and [Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie) each responded to [MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur), and [MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur) responded to [Hodges](bio.zanechodges) and [Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie).
[MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur)’s first work argues that the Gospels teach that one must repent to be saved and that good works and continuing to believe in Jesus are the necessary fruit of saving faith, and [Hodges](bio.zanechodges) argues that neither the Gospels nor the rest of the Bible supports that.
[Hodges](bio.zanechodges) contends that the only condition for salvation is intellectually believing and that other elements such as repentance and surrender are heretical additions to the gospel that result in salvation by works rather than by faith alone.
[Hodges](bio.zanechodges) denies that a person who believes in [Christ](bk.#Christ) must continue believing to possess eternal life someone who previously believed in [Christ](bk.#Christ) can “drop out” of the Christian life, just as a student can drop out of school.
[Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie), though not as extreme as [Hodges](bio.zanechodges), also argues that neither the Gospels nor the rest of the Bible supports that one must repent to be saved or that good works and continuing to believe in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) are the necessary fruit of saving faith.
His main argument is that [God](bk.#God) requires only that people believe in [Jesus Christ](bio.JesusChrist) for him to save them.
He argues that Christians may be in a lifelong state of carnality and may even become unbelieving believers; those who once believed are secure forever even if they turn away.
[Hodges](bio.zanechodges) and [Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie) distinguish between salvation and discipleship based on how [Chafer](bio.LewisChafer) adopted and adapted the categories of carnal and spiritual Christians from higher life theology.
These debates have continued within [evangelicalism](bk.%Evangelicalism_Belief).
More recently, [Wayne Grudem](bio.wayneagrudem_1) and [John MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur) (once again) have helpfully addressed this controversial issue.

## CONCLUSION

This chapter has been a short way of telling the story of higher life theology where it came from, who initially popularized it, and four influential variations on it.
It is important to understand this story before critiquing higher life theology.
But before we begin to critique it, we must answer one more question: What exactly is higher life theology?
The next chapter explains its essence.

# CHAPTER 2: What Is Higher Life Theology?

We will evaluate higher life theology in chapters 3–4, but before we can do that, we must know what it is.
One helpful way to explain higher life theology is to present it in five steps.
These five steps correspond to the five days of sequential, progressive teaching at a typical early [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) (see fig. 2.1).
A week at a [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) focused on the Bible and Christian fellowship.
It was supposed to be like a spiritual resort or more accurately, like a spiritual hospital.
One leading Keswick historian describes those weeklong Keswick meetings as “a spiritual clinic” to help restore Christians who were spiritually sick or wounded.

The diagnosis: sin
The cure: [God](bk.#God)’s provision for victorious Christian living

The mission: powerful Christian service (especially foreign missions)
Everything this chapter asserts is what higher life theology affirms.
Even the illustrations come directly from higher life teaching.
(It would get tiresome to keep repeating phrases such as “According to higher life theology.”)
This chapter presents higher life theology without evaluating it; chapters 3 and 4 evaluate it.

## DAY 1. THE DIAGNOSIS: SIN

Sin is why some Christians are spiritually sick or wounded.
Sin is an indwelling tendency or law, and you can’t eradicate it in this life.
The only way to conquer sin is to continually counteract it; the only law that can counteract the law of sin in the Christian ( 7:23) is the law of the Spirit in [Christ](bk.#Christ) ( 8:2); and the only way for the law of the Spirit in [Christ](bk.#Christ) to counteract the law of sin in the Christian is for the Christian to abide in [Christ](bk.#Christ).
Figure 2.2 summarizes several illustrations that higher life teachers use to clarify this “law of counteraction.”
It is not possible to be sinlessly perfect, but it is possible to live without “known sin.”
The decisive factor in successfully counteracting sin is whether you allow the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) to counteract your sinful nature.
“Christians need not sin, and if they allow the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) to ‘operate invariably’ they will not sin.”

## DAY 2. THE CURE: [GOD](bk.#God)’S PROVISION FOR VICTORIOUS CHRISTIAN LIVING

### FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION: THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF CHRISTIANS

The cure for sin is based on the fundamental proposition that there are two categories of Christians (see fig.
2.3, which uses higher life theology’s own labels).

There are three distinct types of people: 24. Non-Christian (natural) 25. Christian in category 1 (carnal) 26. Christian in category 2 (spiritual)
The way to help non-Christians is to evangelize them so they convert and become Christians.
The way to help Christians in category 1 is to teach them higher life theology so they experience a crisis that moves them from category 1 to category 2.
That crisis or “second blessing” for the Christian is sometimes “as clearly marked as his conversion, in which he passes out of a life of continual feebleness and failure to one of strength and victory, and abiding rest.”
This experience “has been called by various names”: “the second blessing” ([Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1)), “the higher Christian life” ([Boardman](bio.williamboardman)), “the rest of faith,” “the life of consecration,” “the life of faith,” and “the blessed life.”
But it is simply “the Christian life, as it ought to be, but seldom is.”
If you don’t understand higher life theology, you can’t move from category 1 to category 2.

### PROBLEM: WRONG VIEWS ON [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification) RESULT IN DEFEAT (CATEGORY 1)

Defeat (i.e., category 1) characterizes the “average” Christian largely because they believe wrong views on [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
Here are three of those wrong views. 27. Automatic growth.
[Sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is not automatic.
Believers do not automatically progress in [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) like programmed robots.
This view insufficiently accounts for Christian backsliding. 28. [Synergism](bk.%synergism).
This view of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is incorrect because it claims a Christian grows by diligently using the [means of grace](bk.%meansOfGrace) with [God](bk.#God)’s help that is, both [God](bk.#God) and the believer work.
But [God](bk.#God) does everything and the believer does nothing.
The believer’s own strength is not only insufficient for [sanctification](bk.%sanctification); depending on that strength offends [God](bk.#God). 29. Eradication of the law of indwelling sin.
Both the Wesleyan view (i.e., [God](bk.#God) completely and instantaneously eradicates the indwelling sin tendency) and the Reformed view (i.e., a Christian gradually mortifies sin but not completely until glorification) are wrong.
A Christian does not gradually become less sinful; sin is an indwelling tendency that does not change.
Like a barrel of dry gunpowder that could explode at any moment under the right conditions, as a Christian you can fall into the same kind of sin at any moment of your life whether you just converted or have been a Christian for seventy years.

### SOLUTION: SANCTIFICATION BY FAITH RESULTS IN VICTORY (CATEGORY 2)

The correct view is “[sanctification](bk.%sanctification) by faith,” which results in victory (i.e., category 2).
Defeat characterizes the “average” Christian, but victory characterizes the “normal” Christian.
([Sanctification](bk.%sanctification) refers to what happens starting at the crisis.
See fig.
2.4.)
Fig.
2.4.
The Higher Life (or Keswick) View of [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification)
It helps to specify sanctification’s basis, nature, means, result, and agent. 30. On what basis?
The basis for [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is union with [Christ](bk.#Christ).
The key text is 6.
All believers are positionally united to [Christ](bk.#Christ), so it is possible for them to live the victorious Christian life. 31. What is it?
The nature of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is threefold: (1) gift, (2) crisis, and (3) process.
[Sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is a gift that a believer must willingly receive.
It begins with the crisis of consecration, and what follows is a process (see fig.
2.5).

While wrestling with the Lord, [Jacob](bk.#Jacob) ceased resisting (i.e., he yielded or surrendered or “let go”), and he clung to the Lord for a blessing (i.e., he exercised faith or “let [God](bk.#God)”).
[Jacob](bk.#Jacob) (now Israel) lived honestly rather than deceptively.

The Israelites living in the land of [Canaan](bk.@Canaan)
[Jesus](bk.#Jesus) completely, immediately cured people.
Those people remained cured.
[Peter](bk.#Peter) wept bitterly after denying the Lord.
[Peter](bk.#Peter) began living a powerful Christian life.
Believers must experience the crisis before the process can begin.
The [Greek](bk.%GreekLanguage_Language) word translated “present” in 6:13, 16, 19, and 12:1 is in the aorist tense-form, which supports that this “presenting” is a once-for-all-time act of self-surrender.
But Christians may need to repeat that yielding “if, having presented ourselves, we have afterwards withdrawn the gift.”
“The act of consecration” is “done once for all” but still must “be done over and over again” “in the sense of restoration” or “confirmation.”
This yielding is not necessary for justification, but it is necessary for [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
Christians often make this decisive step of yielding immediately after hearing a sermon on the crisis of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification). 32. How?
The means of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is appropriating (i.e., choosing to make use of) the gift by faith alone not by effort or struggle.
Popular phrases for this concept are “[sanctification](bk.%sanctification) by faith” and “holiness by faith.”
Figure 2.6 illustrates the difference between a Christian’s (a) having a position and (b) appropriating that position.

[God](bk.#God) will enable Christians to do what he commands, but unbelief limits [God](bk.#God)’s enabling.
“The will is our main and chief impediment.”
All Christians are united to [Christ](bk.#Christ), but not all experience spiritual power because “the great hindrance that which lies at the root of every other is unbelief.
We limit [God](bk.#God) by our unbelief.”
Christians are unable to deliver themselves, and [God](bk.#God) is unable to deliver Christians unless they freely choose for [God](bk.#God) to deliver them.
[Trumbull](bio.charlesgallaudettrumbull) compares it to conversion: “[God](bk.#God) can save no man unless that man does his part toward salvation.”
That is, a human’s will must “voluntarily and deliberately decide to take what [God](bk.#God) offers us.”
And once a Christian appropriates their position and makes [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) actual, their free will is the only instrument that can keep allowing [God](bk.#God) to deliver them. 33. With what result?
The result of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is spiritual power.
All Christians are united to [Christ](bk.#Christ), but they must appropriate spiritual power through faith.
When a Christian’s faith increases, “the power will flow in.”
Christians without the power of the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) are like a train without an engine or like a power tool without electricity. 34. By whom?
The agent of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit), who imparts [Christ](bk.#Christ) to the believer.
The [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) opposes a Christian’s other indwelling power: the flesh ( 5:16–18).

## DAY 3. THE CRISIS FOR THE CURE: CONSECRATION

“No crisis before Wednesday” was a common saying at the early [Keswick Conventions](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) because the first two days (Monday and Tuesday) laid the groundwork for the crisis of consecration.
Since [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is a crisis plus a following process, it is important to focus on how to experience the crisis so that the process may follow.
“What are the conditions of this Victorious Life?
Only two, and they are very simple.
Surrender and faith.
‘Let go, and let [God](bk.#God).’
 ” Believers enter the higher life through a crisis experience the “twin door” of “surrender and faith.”

### STEP 1: “LET GO” (SURRENDER)

It is at this point in time that Christians completely give themselves to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) as their Master.
“Letting go” includes surrendering to [God](bk.#God) every habit, ambition, hope, loved one, possession, as well as yourself.
Any victory over the power of any sin whatsoever in your life that you have to get by working for it is counterfeit.
Any victory that you have to get by trying for it is counterfeit.
If you have to work for your victory, it is not the real thing; it is not the thing that [God](bk.#God) offers you.
It is not by straining and struggling that this blessed condition is brought about; it comes by a very real dedication of ourselves to [God](bk.#God) for this very purpose, and with this as the special end and aim in view.
Just lie quietly before Him.
Open all the avenues of your being, and let Him come in and take possession of every chamber.
Especially give Him your heart the very seat of your desires, the throne of your affections.
Yield all up to Him, and the Lord will enter, bringing with Him all the riches of His grace and glory, turning your life of duty into a life of liberty and love.

### STEP 2: “LET [God](bk.#God)” (FAITH)

After you “let go,” you must “let [God](bk.#God).”
First you surrender, then you exercise faith.
The secret of complete victory is faith: simply believing that [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) has done and is doing it all.
Victory is entered upon by a single act of faith, as is salvation.
Victory is maintained by the attitude of faith.
But suppose the believer having experienced the miracle of victory over sin through trusting his Lord’s sufficiency, comes, somehow, to doubt that sufficiency?
At once his victory is broken, and he fails.
This is possible at any moment.…
They say at Keswick, “If you should fail, shout Victory!”
Not with any idea of denying the reality of the failure, but in recognition of the fact that [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) has not failed, and that there may be instantaneous and complete restoration through faith in His unimpaired sufficiency.

### “LET GO” + “LET [God](bk.#God)” = CONSECRATION

Steps one and two combined (i.e., “let go” + “let [God](bk.#God)”) equal “consecration.”
Only then can you experience victory over sin.
Some Christians have neither “let go” nor “let [God](bk.#God),” and others have “let go” but not “let [God](bk.#God).”
That second group is “sure to be defeated.”
But after you “let go and let [God](bk.#God),” [God](bk.#God) is obligated to keep you from sin’s power.
The key is resting (not struggling) and “trusting” (not “trying”).
If any of you are making the mistake of trying to live the victorious life, you are cheating yourself out of it, for the victory you get by trying for it is a counterfeit victory.
You must substitute another word; not try, but trust, and you cannot try and trust at the same time.
Trying is what we do, and trusting is what we let the Lord do.…
The counterfeit victory means a struggle; whatever we do, we do by our efforts.
Oh, yes, we ask Him to help us, and then we feel that we must do a lot to help Him as if He needed to be helped!
In real victory, He does it all.
We do not dare to help.
We realize that the battle is His.
“Our efforts” not only play no part in victory, “they can and do effectually prevent such victory.”
When you exercise your free will to “let [God](bk.#God),” you are not exerting “effort.”
Consecration is a crisis that occurs instantaneously.
Victory comes immediately, not gradually; it is an instantaneous gift.
“A victory gained … by a gradual conquest over evil, getting one sin after another out of our life, is counterfeit victory.”
“The victorious life, the life of freedom from the power of sin, is not a gradual gift.
There is no such thing as a gradual gift.
And victory is a gift.
It is not a growth.…
We only begin to grow normally, grow as [God](bk.#God) wants us to grow, after we have entered into victory.”

## DAY 4. THE PRESCRIPTION: [SPIRIT-FILLING](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)

When you experience a crisis of consecration (i.e., you “let go” and “let [God](bk.#God)”), you are Spirit-filled.
Continuing to be Spirit-filled is the only way to spiritually grow and to avoid relapsing to category 1 (see fig.
2.3).
And the way to remain Spirit-filled is to continue to let go and let [God](bk.#God).

### IS [Spirit-Filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) DIFFERENT THAN [Spirit-Baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit)?

[Andrew Murray](bio.AndrewMurray.1) shared his personal testimony at the 1895 [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People):
Some of you have heard how I have pressed upon you the two stages in the Christian life, and the step from one to the other.
The first ten years of my spiritual life were spent manifestly on the lower stage.…
Later on, my mind became much exercised about the baptism of the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit), and I gave myself to [God](bk.#God) as perfectly as I could to receive this baptism of the Spirit.
Yet there was failure.
Early Keswick proponents generally used “[Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)” and “[Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit)” terminology synonymously, but in the 1900s, Keswick proponents gradually began to use [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) terminology for what all Christians experience when they first repent and believe and to reserve [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) terminology for what only some Christians experience at consecration.
That helped distinguish the Keswick view from Wesleyanism and Pentecostalism (see chap.
1).

### WHO CAN EXPERIENCE [Spirit-Filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)?

All Christians have the Spirit, but not all Christians are Spirit-filled.
Only consecrated Christians can be Spirit-filled.
That is, only Christians who have experienced a crisis of consecration (i.e., they have “let go and let [God](bk.#God)”) can be Spirit-filled.
The practical point is: have you ever claimed and received the power of the [Holy Ghost](bk.#GodTheSpirit) as such?
When he came down on Pentecost and filled disciples, this experience was both subsequent to and different from conversion.…
Grant that Pentecost was the filling of an exhaustless Reservoir for the Church of all ages, what is to hinder every one of us from being filled at that Reservoir, and so having our own individual Pentecost?…
The practical question remains, “Are you baptized with the [Holy Ghost](bk.#GodTheSpirit)?”

### WHAT IS [Spirit-Filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)?

In the command “Be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)” ( 5:18), the Spirit is the content of the filling.
As water fills a container, so the Spirit fills a Christian (see fig.
2.7).
But a Spirit-filled Christian must not “relapse” and experience “spiritual leakage.”
That would require “a refilling.”
There is no guarantee that a Christian who is Spirit-filled will remain Spirit-filled.
Just as Christians must allow the Spirit to fill them initially, so Christians must continue to allow the Spirit to keep on filling them.

2.7.

The same life-giving properties in the air are in that person.
Iron in the fire
Iron by itself is black, cold, and hard, but iron in the fire is red, hot, and malleable because the fire is in the iron.

### WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF [Spirit-Filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)?

Christians must meet specific conditions in order to be Spirit-filled.
Those conditions include consecration (“let go and let [God](bk.#God)”), confident appropriation, patience, holy desire, and cleansing from all known sin.
The results of [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) include [Christ](bk.#Christ)-likeness, moral purity, deliverance from sin’s power, power for service (especially evangelism), assurance of salvation, consciousness of [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s presence, and detailed and direct guidance for decision-making.

## DAY 5. THE MISSION: POWERFUL CHRISTIAN SERVICE

Powerful Christian service follows from days 1–4.
If Christians experience consecration and [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit), then they will serve [God](bk.#God) with power, especially by evangelizing non-Christians both at home and abroad (foreign missions).

## CONCLUSION

Higher life theology asserts that there are two categories of Christians.
The way for a Christian to move from “category 1” (i.e., carnal) to “category 2” (i.e., spiritual) is to “let go and let [God](bk.#God).”
The crisis of consecration happens instantaneously, and the process of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) follows.
Christians maintain that condition by continually allowing the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) to fill them, which results in spiritual power.
That’s what higher life theology is.
Now that we have told the story of where it came from and explained what it is, we are ready to analyze it (part 2).

# PART 2: Why Higher Life Theology Is Harmful

Higher life theology is not all bad.
It has at least five commendable characteristics: 35. It exalts [Christ](bk.#Christ).
It exhorts you to depend on [Christ](bk.#Christ) rather than yourself. 36. It is warmly devotional.
It is better to be a [God](bk.#God)-loving, holiness-pursuing Christian who affirms higher life theology than a professing Christian who is theologically accurate but cold-hearted and immoral.
Whatever else Keswick’s teaching may have gotten wrong, it was not wrong to say to all Christians that there is more joy, more peace, more love, more power, and more fruit to be enjoyed in [Christ](bk.#Christ) than we are presently enjoying.…
Any view of the Christian life that does not promote the desire for, and the pursuit of, this inexpressible fullness this more is as defective as the view that says its usual way of coming is through a single crisis experience of full consecration. 37. It emphasizes that Christians must practice spiritual disciplines.
It encourages Christians to read the Bible, pray, fellowship, hear and respond to preaching, and evangelize non-Christians locally and globally.
And setting aside an entire week to focus on the Bible, fellowship, and rest is a recipe to refresh Christians. 38. It affirms fundamental orthodoxy.
It affirms the type of Bible teachings that are “of first importance” (1 \_\_\_\_15:3).
Evangelical Christians have various views on progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) (see figs.
1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2.4, and 3.8), but they have one view on the most core doctrines (e.g., the Trinity and justification by faith alone).
Higher life theology is not heresy it does not deny core Bible teachings that are “of first importance.” 39. It has a legacy of faithful Christian leaders.
Many of the men who prominently spread higher life theology were sincere, devout, godly men who were above reproach, and they commendably desired that Christians be holy that they walk by the Spirit and not gratify the desires of the flesh.
[Hudson Taylor](bio.hudsonjtaylor) was one of the most outstanding foreign missionaries in the modern missionary movement, and many of the writings of [H. C. G. Moule](bio.HendleyMoule) and [W. H. Griffith Thomas](bio.WHGriffithThomas) the best theologians of the early Keswick movement are insightful.
When we think of the honoured names which have been associated with Keswick like those of [Handley Moule](bio.HendleyMoule), [Webb-Peploe](bio.hwwebbpeploe_1), [Andrew Murray](bio.AndrewMurray.1), [A. T. Pierson](bio.arthurtpierson), we have to reckon with a movement which enlisted the support of cultured and devoted servants of [Christ](bk.#Christ) and one hesitates to embark upon criticism.
But the cause neither of truth nor of love is promoted by suppressing warranted criticism.
That last sentence transitions us from affirming higher life theology to critiquing it with “warranted criticism.”
But how can higher life theology be so bad if godly Christians like [Andrew Murray](bio.AndrewMurray.1) and [Hudson Taylor](bio.hudsonjtaylor) believed it?
Higher life theology commendably emphasizes that Christians must be holy and sacrificially serve [God](bk.#God), but holy and fruitful living by no means distinguishes higher life theology from other views of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
All the major views on progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) have proponents who are exemplary, inspiring Christians.
Disagreeing with a particular view of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) in no way questions whether proponents are godly Christians.
The bottom line is that we shouldn’t determine our view of the Christian life by counting up whom we perceive to be the most holy Christians and seeing which view has the most adherents.
One factor is decisive: What does Scripture teach?
As [John Murray](bio.JohnMurray) says, “The cause neither of truth nor of love is promoted by suppressing warranted criticism.”
So constructively criticizing a faulty view of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) can actually advance the cause of truth and love.
“Right thinking about the gospel produces right living in the gospel.”
So while I can affirm that higher life theology is not all bad, I still think it’s harmful for at least ten reasons. 40. Disjunction.
It creates two categories of Christians. 41. A form of perfectionism.
It portrays a shallow and incomplete view of sin in the Christian life. 42. A form of quietism.
It emphasizes passivity, not activity. 43. A form of Pelagianism.
It portrays the Christian’s free will as autonomously starting and stopping [sanctification](bk.%sanctification). 44. Misreading.
It does not interpret and apply the Bible accurately. 45. False Assurance.
It assures spurious “Christians” they are saved. 46. Methodology.
It uses superficial formulas for instantaneous [sanctification](bk.%sanctification). 47. Addiction.
It fosters dependency on experiences at special holiness meetings. 48. Abuse.
It frustrates and disillusions the have-nots. 49. Spin.
It misinterprets personal experiences.
The first reason is by far the most important.
That’s why it’s the longest.
It gets an entire chapter (chap.
3).
Then the next chapter explains the other nine reasons (chap. 4).

## CHAPTER 3: The Fundamental Reason Higher Life Theology Is Harmful

The fundamental reason higher life theology is harmful is that it creates two categories of Christians.
It divides Christians into two distinct types (see fig.
2.3).
This is the linchpin reason that higher life theology is wrong.
Rather than addressing every contrast in figure 2.3, what follows addresses five of the most significant contrasts (see fig.
3.1).
Fig.
3.1.
Higher Life Theology vs. the New Testament
Higher Life Theology
The New Testament
Some Christians are justified but not being sanctified, and others are both justified and being sanctified.
All Christians are both justified and being sanctified.
Some Christians are carnal, and others are spiritual.
All Christians are spiritual; none are permanently carnal.
Some Christians are not Spirit-baptized, and others are Spirit-baptized.
All Christians are Spirit-baptized.
Some Christians are not Spirit-filled, and others are Spirit-filled.
All Christians are Spirit-filled to various degrees.
Some Christians do not abide in Christ, and others do abide in [Christ](bk.#Christ).
All Christians abide in [Christ](bk.#Christ) to various degrees.
The rest of this chapter unpacks those five contrasts.

### 1. ALL CHRISTIANS ARE BOTH JUSTIFIED AND BEING SANCTIFIED

The Bible uses three grammatical tenses for [sanctification](bk.%sanctification), and our focus here concerns the relationship of justification to progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) (see fig.
3.2):
Fig.
3.2.
Three Tenses of [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification)
Past
Present
Future
Definitive or positional [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) (occurs simultaneously with conversion and justification)
Progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification)
Perfect, complete, or final [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) (i.e., [glorification](bk.%glorification))
“I am (or have been) sanctified.”
“I am being sanctified.”
“I will be sanctified.”
[God](bk.#God) sets a Christian apart from sin’s penalty and their “old self” in [Adam](bk.#Adam) ( 6; 20:32; 26:18; 1 \_**\_1:2; 6:11; 10:10, 14).
[God](bk.#God) gradually sets a Christian apart from sin’s power and practice ( 17:17; 2 \_\_**3:18; 7:1; 1:6).
[God](bk.#God) sets a Christian apart from sin’s presence and possibility ( 3:21; 1 **\_\_**3:12–13; 24).
When the New Testament uses the holiness word-group (e.g., “holy” and “sanctify” or “make holy”), it usually refers to definitive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) rather than progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
But the concept of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) permeates the New Testament.
Progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is “that gracious operation of the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit), involving our responsible participation, by which he delivers us from the pollution of sin, renews our entire nature according to the image of [God](bk.#God), and enables us to live lives that are pleasing to him.”
Figure 3.3 contrasts justification and progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification):

Gradually made righteous
Objective, judicial (non-experiential): legal, forensic position
Subjective, experiential: daily experience
External: outside the believer
Internal: inside the believer

[Christ](bk.#Christ)’s righteousness imparted, worked out experientially
Instantly removes sin’s guilt and penalty

Gradually transforms character
Quantity
All Christians share the same legal standing

A continuing process: gradual, maturing, lifelong
Progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is distinct from justification yet inseparable from justification.
Faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is never alone.
[God](bk.#God)’s grace through the power of his Spirit ensures that the same faith that justifies a Christian also sanctifies a Christian.
Higher life theology chronologically separates justification from progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) by emphasizing a crisis of consecration that occurs at a point in time after justification and enables progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) to begin.
That essentially divides [Christ](bk.#Christ) as one whom people can “take” as their justifier (or Savior) without “taking” him as their sanctifier (or Lord).
But the New Testament teaches that from the moment of justification, progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is experientially actual (not merely potential or possible) for all Christians.
It is impossible for a Christian to be justified without at the same time experiencing progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
That theme features prominently in 5–8.
The primary issue 1:18–11:36 addresses is righteousness.
[God](bk.#God) is righteous in that he always acts in accordance with what is right.
“The righteousness of [God](bk.#God)” is what [God](bk.#God) is when he saves you and what he gives you when he saves you.
It is “his unswerving commitment to preserve the honor of his name and display his glory.”
• We are all sinners who need [God](bk.#God)’s righteousness because [God](bk.#God) has condemned us (1:18–3:20).
• We can obtain [God](bk.#God)’s righteousness by faith alone (3:21–4:25).
• We experience glorious results when we obtain [God](bk.#God)’s righteousness (chaps.
5–8):

- [God](bk.#God) reconciles us to himself (chap. 5).
- [God](bk.#God) frees us from the dominating power of sin (chap. 6).
- [God](bk.#God) frees us from the law (chap. 7).
- [God](bk.#God) gives us security or assurance under the reign of grace (chap. 8).
  6 is the key chapter in the Bible on progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
  Figure 3.4 traces the argument in 6 by phrasing it.
  It codes some recurring concepts, especially sin (underlined), slavery/freedom (caps), death (small caps), and life (bold).
  You don’t need to understand all the nuances of phrasing to get the gist of figure 3.4: the resounding theme of 6 is that all Christians without exception inevitably “walk in newness of life” ( 6:4).
  Everyone is a slave either a slave to sin or a slave to [God](bk.#God) and righteousness.
  If you are a Christian, then you serve a new master; sin is no longer your master.
  “The whole point of 6” is that “[God](bk.#God) not only frees us from sin’s penalty (justification), but He frees us from sin’s tyranny as well ([sanctification](bk.%sanctification)).”
  “A major flaw” with how higher life theology interprets 6 is that “[Paul](bk.#Paul) is not telling believers how a justified person can lead a holy life, but why he must lead a holy life.”

### 2. ALL CHRISTIANS ARE SPIRITUAL; NONE ARE PERMANENTLY CARNAL (1 Corinthians2:6–3:4)

The key text in this spiritual-versus-carnal debate is 1 Corinthians2:6–3:4, and figure 3.5 lays out that passage by phrasing it.
Again, you don’t need to understand all the nuances of phrasing to see the debated issue: [Paul](bk.#Paul) describes people as natural, spiritual, and carnal (or “of the flesh”).
The issue is whether those are three distinct categories.

In 1 Corinthians2:14–15, [Paul](bk.#Paul) describes people as either “natural” ([ψυχικός](lemma.lbs.el.ψυχικός), ) or “spiritual” ([πνευματικός](lemma.lbs.el.πνευματικός), ).
Those who are “natural” are the opposite of “spiritual” because they do not have the Spirit (cf. 19).
Those who are “spiritual” have the Spirit.
The NIV translates those terms most clearly: “the person without the Spirit” and “the person with the Spirit.”
Thus, all humans are in one of two categories (see fig.
3.7):

[Paul](bk.#Paul) then rebukes the Corinthian believers for not acting like who they are (3:1–4).
He addresses the Corinthians as “people of the flesh” (3:1) or “carnal” (KJV, NKJV).
The question is whether “spiritual” and “carnal” are two distinct, exclusive categories into which believers fit.
Based on the way the Corinthians were acting, [Paul](bk.#Paul) could not address them as who they actually were.
Although they were people who had the Spirit, they were acting “as” ([ὡς](lemma.lbs.el.ὡς), ) or “like” people not having the Spirit because people having the Spirit characteristically live a certain way.
That is why [Paul](bk.#Paul) addresses them this way.
He is not laying out three categories into which all people fall: natural, carnal, and spiritual.
Nor is [Paul](bk.#Paul) using [pneumatikos](lemma.lbs.el.πνευματικός) in two separate ways to all Christians in 2:15 but to only mature Christians in 3:1.
His concern is singular: not to suggest classes of Christians or grades of spirituality, but to get the Corinthians to stop thinking [and behaving] like the people of this present age.…
To suggest two meanings for
[ ] … misses [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s point.…
His ultimate point is: “Stop it!
People of the Spirit simply must stop behaving the way you are.”
“Natural” people characteristically act in a “carnal” or “fleshly” way.
The reverse is true as well: those who live in a characteristically fleshly way are unbelievers.
Believers may temporarily live in a fleshly way, but believers by definition live in a characteristically righteous way.
[D. A. Carson](bio.DACarson) explains that by calling the Corinthians carnal,
[Paul](bk.#Paul) does not have in mind someone who has made a profession of faith, carried on in the Christian way for a short while, and then reverted to a lifestyle indistinguishable in every respect from that of the world.
…
Of course, if professing Christians slip far enough, some further category has to be found for them.
[Paul](bk.#Paul) has one.…
“Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.
Do you not realize that [Christ Jesus](bk.#Jesus) is in you unless, of course, you fail the test?”
(2 \_**\_13:5).
In other words, if their drift away from the gospel becomes serious enough, [Paul](bk.#Paul) questions whether they are Christians at all.…
What this means is that it will not do to apply “carnal Christian” or “worldly Christian” to every person who has made a profession of faith, perhaps years ago, but who for umpteen years has lived without any evidence of Christian faith, life, repentance, values, or interest.
In such instances it is far more likely than not that we are dealing with spurious conversions.
Christians who are “carnal” ( [ ] and [σαρκικός](lemma.lbs.el.σαρκικός) [ ] in 1 \_\_**3:1, 3) are only temporarily carnal not permanently carnal.
“The carnal Christian is simply a genuine Christian (Spirit-man) temporarily gone astray.”
Furthermore, the carnality does not necessarily extend equally to every area of a Christian’s life, nor does it characterize a Christian’s entire lifestyle.
In the case of the Corinthians, [Paul](bk.#Paul) calls them fleshly specifically because they were being sinfully divisive.
In this sense, one could say that all Christians prior to their glorification are fleshly to some degree in some areas but not characteristically so overall.
What this passage does not support is a permanent category called “carnal Christians” in which fruitless, fleshly professing believers may remain throughout their entire “Christian” life (see fig.
3.8).

### 3. ALL CHRISTIANS ARE SPIRIT-BAPTIZED (1 Corinthians12:13)

The New Testament mentions [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) eleven times:
• [John the Baptist](bk.#JohntheBaptist) predicts that it would occur ( 3:11; 1:8; 3:16; 1:33).
• [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) guarantees that it would occur ( 1:5; cf.
11:13; 24:49; 7:37–39; 14–17).
• [Peter](bk.#Peter) affirms that it did occur ( 11:16).
• [Paul](bk.#Paul) explains its theological significance ( 6:1–4; 1 \_**\_12:13; 3:27; 4:5; 2:12).
[Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) is [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s judicially placing Christians in the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) when [God](bk.#God) regenerates them, thus placing them into the body of [Christ](bk.#Christ).
The central text for [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) is 1 \*\***\_\_**\*\***12:13: “For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body [Jews](bk.#Jews) or [Greeks](bk.#Greeks), slaves or free and all were made to drink of one Spirit” (1 \_\_\_\_12:13, emphasis added).
All Christians are Spirit-baptized.
All Christians share “one baptism” ( 4:5).
The New Testament never commands or exhorts Christians to pursue or receive [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit) because they are already Spirit-baptized.
While some advocates of higher life theology distinguish between Christians who are not Spirit-baptized (category 1) and those who are (category 2), most have conceded that all Christians are Spirit-baptized.
But all advocates of higher life theology argue that not all Christians are Spirit-filled.

### 4. ALL CHRISTIANS ARE SPIRIT-FILLED TO VARIOUS DEGREES ( 5:18)

5:18 commands, “Be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)” ([πληροῦσθε](lemma.lbs.el.πληρόω)
,
).
That is the only time [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) appears in [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letters, which suggests that higher life theology is out of balance when it makes [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) the secret key to victorious Christian living.
Before higher life theology in the 1800s, Christians did not emphasize [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) as the key to victorious Christian living.
That does not mean that [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) is unimportant.
But the way higher life theology has focused on [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) is unwarranted.
I’ll demonstrate that by answering six questions:

5.  What does “be filled” mean?
6.  What does “with the Spirit” mean?
7.  What are the results of Spirit-filling?
8.  How do you obey the command “be filled with the Spirit”?
9.  Are all Christians Spirit-filled?
10. Doesn’t a command imply that you either obey it or disobey it?

### WHAT DOES “BE FILLED” MEAN?

The first half of 5:18 helps you understand the second half: “And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit).”
Alcohol strongly influences a drunk person.
A person who is normally timid and soft-spoken may become bold and outspoken when under the influence of alcohol.
“Debauchery” characterizes a drunk person.
“Be filled” is parallel to “do not get drunk.”
Just as alcohol strongly influences a drunk person, so the Spirit must strongly influence a Christian.
That is the point of the analogy.
It is common to define “be filled” as “be controlled.”
I think that is too strong because some may misunderstand “control” to mean absolute or total control in the sense that the Christian is completely passive (i.e., “let go and let [God](bk.#God)”).
It is more precise to explain “be filled” as “be strongly influenced” because there are degrees of drunkenness.
If the Spirit “totally controls” a Christian, then that implies the Christian will be completely sinless.
“Be filled” translates [πληροῦσθε](lemma.lbs.el.πληρόω) ([plērousthe](lemma.lbs.el.πληρόω)), which is in the present tense-form; in context, this communicates that Christians should make this their ongoing habit or custom.
That verb is also passive, which means that the Christian is not the person who does the influencing.
But that does not mean that you should passively wait for [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) to happen.
[God](bk.#God) addresses this command to you, so you are responsible to obey it.
Just as you are responsible not to let alcohol strongly influence you, so you are responsible to be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit).

### WHAT DOES “WITH THE SPIRIT” MEAN?

Assuming that [Paul](bk.#Paul) refers to the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) rather than a human spirit, the main issue is whether “with the Spirit” ([ἐν](lemma.lbs.el.ἐν)
, ) indicates content or means (see fig.
3.9).
Fig.
3.9.
Illustrations of Content vs. Means
Content
Means
Fill a pool with water.
Fill a pool with a hose.
Fill a tire with air.
Fill a tire with an air-compressor.
Fill your stomach with food and drink.
Fill your stomach with forks and cups.
Fill a tooth’s cavity with amalgam or composite.
Fill a tooth’s cavity with dental tools.
Be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit).
Be filled by the Spirit.
Most interpreters whether proponents of higher life theology or not assume that means “with the Spirit” (i.e., content), not “by the Spirit” (i.e., means).
If [Paul](bk.#Paul) intends means and not content, then other passages in Ephesians that use the verb fill may indicate who does the filling (i.e., [Christ](bk.#Christ) 1:22; 4:10) and what the content is (i.e., “the fullness of [God](bk.#God)” or [God](bk.#God)’s moral excellence 3:19).
Thus, [Wallace](bio.danielbwallace) concludes, “Believers are to be filled by [Christ](bk.#Christ) by means of the Spirit with the content of the fullness of [God](bk.#God).”
I used to be more confident that [Paul](bk.#Paul) intends to communicate means and not content, but now I’m not as sure because you can make a good case for content.
I wonder if it may be both parallel to how wine is both the content and means of getting drunk: “And do not get drunk with wine … but be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit).”

### WHAT ARE RESULTS OF [Spirit-Filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)?

You can know you are Spirit-filled by comparing your life with the five result-participles in 5:19–21: “addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, giving thanks always and for everything to [God](bk.#God) the Father in the name of our Lord [Jesus Christ](bio.JesusChrist), submitting to one another out of reverence for [Christ](bk.#Christ).”
The degree to which those results are evident in your life is the degree to which the Spirit is influencing you.

### HOW DO YOU OBEY THE COMMAND “BE [Filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)”?

Can you do something to increase the level to which the Spirit influences you?
The most helpful passage in this regard is 3:16–4:1, the parallel passage to 5:18–6:9.
In 3:16–17, [Paul](bk.#Paul) lists results that are virtually identical to those in 5:19–20.
But in 3:16, the initial command before the result participles is different: “Let the word of [Christ](bk.#Christ) dwell in you richly.”
That is parallel to the command “Be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit).”
So letting the word of [Christ](bk.#Christ) dwell in you richly is a way to let the Spirit strongly influence you.
That is a lifelong process.

### ARE ALL CHRISTIANS SPIRIT-FILLED?

Higher life theology says No, but so do some who oppose higher life theology.
Both assume that Christians are either completely filled or empty.
It seems more accurate to say that the Spirit is influencing every believer to some degree some more strongly than others.
It is not all or nothing.
The issue is not whether a Christian has all of the Spirit because a Christian is by definition someone who has the Spirit (e.g., 1 \_\*\*\_2:14–15).
The issue is whether the Spirit has all of the Christian.
Being Spirit-filled is not like turning on a light by flipping a toggle switch.
It is like a dimmer switch that is always on; sometimes the light is bright, and sometimes it is not so bright.
[Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) is not a mystical experience limited to an elite group of Christians who have experienced a crisis of consecration.
[Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) occurs in all Christians to some degree just like Christians bear fruit to different degrees (see 13:23).

### DOESN’T A COMMAND IMPLY THAT YOU EITHER OBEY IT OR DISOBEY IT?

Not necessarily.
Not all commands are as simple as ones I might give to my little children: “Sit down.”
“Get in the van.”
“Go to your room.”
“Throw the ball.”
Those commands are straightforward.
The child either obeys or disobeys.
It’s like a toggle switch the light is either on or off.
There’s no dimmer.
Higher life theology rejects the possibility that all Christians are [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) to various degrees because it assumes that the command “Be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)” indicates that Christians either completely obey it or completely disobey it.
In the New Testament there are over 1,400 commands directed to “you” (i.e., second-person imperatives).
Most of them appeal to your will and assume that you can obey the command.
And most have a black-and-white nature; you either completely obey them or don’t.
But some commands that the New Testament addresses to Christians are not all-or-nothing.
Obeying and disobeying these commands are not always like flipping a toggle switch but may be more like moving a dimmer switch.
Here are some commands that you can obey to various degrees:
• “make disciples of all nations” ( 28:19)
• “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind” ( 12:2)
• “glorify [God](bk.#God) in your body” (1 \_\_**6:20)
• “do all to the glory of [God](bk.#God)” (1 \_**\_10:31)
• “do not go on sinning” (1 \_\_**15:34)
• “through love serve one another” ( 5:13)
• “walk by the Spirit” ( 5:16)
• “Be kind to one another” ( 4:32)
• “be imitators of [God](bk.#God)” ( 5:1)
• “walk in love” ( 5:2)
• “Walk as children of light” ( 5:8)
• “Look carefully then how you walk” ( 5:15)
• “do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is” ( 5:17)
• “be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)” ( 5:18)
• “Husbands, love your wives” ( 5:25)
• “be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might” ( 6:10)
• “Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in [Christ Jesus](bio.JesusChrist)” ( 2:5)
• “rejoice in the Lord” ( 3:1)
• “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice” ( 4:4)
• “encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing” (1 **\_\_**5:11)
• “Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances” (1 **\_\_**5:16–18)
• “Fight the good fight of the faith” (1 \_**\_6:12)
• “as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct” (1 \_\_**1:15)
• “love one another earnestly from a pure heart” (1 \_**\_1:22)
• “Do not love the world or the things in the world” (1 \_\_\_\*\*2:15)
Here are six observations about those commands:

11. Christians obey some commands to various degrees.
    I love my wife, but I could love her to a greater degree ( 5:25).
12. Christians obey broad and all-encompassing commands (e.g., “glorify [God](bk.#God)”) to various degrees in various areas.
13. The command “be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)” ( 5:18) occurs in the context of similar commands in 4–6 (cf.
    3:1–2, 18–19, 23; 4:2).
    That makes it even more likely that “be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)” is not an all-or-nothing command.
14. In 1 **\*\***\_\_**\*\***5:11, [Paul](bk.#Paul) commands the Thessalonians to do what they are already doing.
    That further supports that [Paul](bk.#Paul) could command Christians to be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) when they are already [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit).
15. Some commands are characteristically true of all believers to various degrees.
    For example, 5:16 (“walk by the Spirit”) all Christians characteristically keep in step with the Spirit to some degree because the only other option is to “gratify the desires of the flesh,” and “those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of [God](bk.#God)” ( 5:16, 21).
    Or 1 **\_**2:15 (“Do not love the world or the things in the world”) all Christians don’t love the world to various degrees because the rest of the passage continues, “If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”
16. These commands are [God](bk.#God)-ordained means to enable Christians to persevere similar to passages like 1 Corinthians9:24; 2:12; 3:12–15; 12:14; and 21.
    [God](bk.#God) enables all genuine Christians to persevere, so all Christians will persevere.
    But Christians must never rationalize, “Since I am already a Christian, I am persevering by definition, so I do not need to be concerned about obeying those commands.”
    [God](bk.#God) forbid!
    Such commands are [God](bk.#God)-ordained [means of grace](bk.%meansOfGrace) for Christians to continue persevering.
    Similarly, commands such as “Love one another” and “Be [filled with the Spirit](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)” are [God](bk.#God)-ordained [means of grace](bk.%meansOfGrace) for Christians to continue to mature.
    Such commands should convict Christians and spur them to obey to greater degrees by [God](bk.#God)’s grace.
    Christians must never rationalize, “Since I am already obeying this command to a certain degree, I do not need to be concerned about obeying it to a greater degree.”
    [God](bk.#God) forbid!
    Another command that you can obey to various degrees is in 15:4: “Abide in me, and I in you.”

## 5. ALL CHRISTIANS ABIDE IN [CHRIST](bk.#Christ) TO VARIOUS DEGREES (John 15:1–10)

    I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.
    Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
    Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.
    Abide in me, and I in you.
    As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.
    I am the vine; you are the branches.
    Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
    If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.
    If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
    By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
    As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.
    Abide in my love.
    If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love.
    ( 15:1–10)
    The verb “abide” in verse 4 translates ( ).
    The ESV, KJV, NKJV, and NASB all translate it as “abide.”
    But abide can sound strangely mystical.
    Largely because higher life theology is so influential, many Christians desire to become Christians who abide an experience they view as a deeper, more intimate resting in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) that is a second tier in the Christian life.
    Higher life theology assumes that only some believers abide: those who do not abide are carnal Christians, and those who abide are spiritual or Spirit-filled Christians.
    But the New Testament teaches that all believers characteristically abide to some degree and that the concept is a metaphor for perseverance.
    basically means to remain, which is why several modern translations render it as “remain” in 15:4 (NIV, NET, CSB, NLT, CEB, NJB).
    [Μένω](lemma.lbs.el.μένω) never occurs in the New Testament in a way that supports a category of Christians who do not abide.
    15:1–10 is the main text for abiding, and there are three major views on the passage.
    The key issue is identifying the fruitless branch in verses 2 and 6.

18. The fruitless branch represents a genuine Christian who forfeits their salvation and then experiences eternal damnation.
19. The fruitless branch represents a carnal Christian whom the Father either tenderly nurtures or severely chastises.
20. The fruitless branch represents a professing Christian who evidences that their connection to [Christ](bk.#Christ) is superficial and then experiences eternal damnation.
    Higher life theology holds the second view, and I think the third is correct.
    I’ll walk through the passage to explain why.

### WHAT DOES THE METAPHOR OF ABIDING MEAN ( 15:1–6)?

A metaphor is an implied comparison without like or as.
For example, “All flesh is grass” ( 40:6) or “[Herod](bk.#Herod.2) is a fox.”
A metaphor has three parts: (1) the topic or item that the image illustrates; (2) the image; and (3) the point of similarity or comparison.
Sometimes one or two of the three components may be implicit rather than explicit.

21. All flesh is grass.
22. Topic: All flesh.
23. Image: grass.
24. Point of similarity: short-lived, perishable.
25. [Herod](bk.#Herod.2) is a fox.
26. Topic: [Herod](bk.#Herod.2).
27. Image: fox.
28. Point of similarity: Four legs?
    Red?
    Furry?
    No, sly.
    Warning: Talking about the point of similarity this way can be misleading.
    “[Herod](bk.#Herod.2) is a fox” and “[Herod](bk.#Herod.2) is sly” are not identical statements.
    You can’t substitute “sly” for “fox” and maintain an equivalent meaning with all the same connotations.
    A metaphor communicates distinctively.
    But breaking down the components like this is a helpful way to analyze it.
    Let’s try doing this for an extended metaphor in 15.
    (This part of the book sounds a little like a commentary, but stick with me because 15 is a key passage for either supporting or refuting higher life theology.
    I attempt to show that 15 refutes higher life theology.)
    Analyzing this extended metaphor is more challenging than analyzing a simple statement like “[Herod](bk.#Herod.2) is a fox” because that simple statement explicitly names the topic and image.
    But the extended metaphor in 15 includes several images without explicitly naming the topics.
    Figure 3.10 displays the topics that the images in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ metaphor illustrate as well as the point of similarity between each topic and image.

    a. A vine pours life into its branches, and that is the only way its branches can be fruitful.
    In contrast to barren [Israel](bk.#IsraelHouse) (cf. 5:1–7; 2:21), [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) is “the true vine” ( 15:1), the exclusive source of fruitfulness.
    b.
    A vinedresser increases the fruitfulness of the vine by pruning it, that is, removing dead branches or stems and superfluous or undesired parts.
    Verse 2 contains a word play: [αἴρει](lemma.lbs.el.αἴρω) ( , “he takes away, removes”) and [καθαίρει](lemma.lbs.el.καθαίρω) ( , “he prunes”).
    c.
    Every unfruitful branch connected to the vine (“in me,” v. 2) is removed, thrown away, dried up, gathered, cast into the fire, and burned (v. 6).
    Unfruitful branches show that they are only superficially connected to the vine.
    As [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) spoke these words to his eleven disciples, [Judas](bk.#Judas) was showing that he was only superficially connected to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus):
    Now before the Feast of the Passover, when [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
    During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of [Judas Iscariot](bk.#Judas), [Simon](bk.#Simon.7)’s son, to betray him.…
    [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean.
    And you are clean, but not every one of you.”
    For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”
    ( 13:1–2, 10–11)
    [Judas](bk.#Judas) betrayed [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
    In contrast to [Judas](bk.#Judas), the eleven disciples were fruitful and clean.
    [Judas](bk.#Judas) represents spurious believers who are only superficially connected to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus), and the eleven disciples represent genuine believers who are vitally connected to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
    d. Verses 2 and 3 employ another word play: [καθαίρει](lemma.lbs.el.καθαίρω) ( , “he prunes”) and ( , “clean”).
    A vinedresser prunes branches with a knife.
    He personally gives careful attention to each fruitful branch, and he cuts or snips off parts of fruitful branches so that they will bear more fruit.
    The Father’s instrument for pruning the eleven disciples was [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ words.
    e. [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) refers to no fruit (vv. 2, 4), fruit (v. 2), more fruit (v. 2), and much fruit (vv. 5, 8).
    Fruit is what branches produce when they are vitally connected to the vine.
    f. Branches that produce fruit show that they are vitally connected to the vine.
    Professing Christians who do not produce fruit (e.g., [Judas](bk.#Judas)) show that they are only superficially connected to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus), and Christians who produce fruit (e.g., the eleven disciples) show that they are vitally connected to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
    Christians must abide in order to bear fruit.

### WHAT DOES [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ COMMAND TO ABIDE MEAN (John 15:4a)?

occurs ten times in verses 4–10 (v. 4 [3×], 5, 6, 7 [2×], 9, 10 [2×]), and [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) implies it twice (vv. 4, 5).
But [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) does not initially define abiding; he commands it: “Abide in me, and I in you” (v. 4 ).
This command implies that believers are already vitally connected to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) and are responsible to maintain that vital connection.
Such a command is a [God](bk.#God)-ordained means for believers to persevere.

### WHAT REASONS DOES [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) GIVE FOR ABIDING (John 15:4–6)?

Three reasons: (1) Fruitfulness is impossible apart from abiding in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) (vv. 4–5).
(2) Abiding results in fruitfulness (v. 5).
(3) Failing to abide results in final judgment (v. 6).
The burned branch in verse 6 must refer to people who have professed to follow [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) but who did not actually follow him.
They appeared to be connected, but they were not actually connected.
“They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.
But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us” (1 **\_**2:19).
All genuine believers are fruitful (cf. 7:16–17; 6; 2:10; 2:14–26).
The fruitless branches in 15 do not represent non-Spirit-filled believers in contrast to Spirit-filled believers.
Fruitless branches represent counterfeit professing believers whom [God](bk.#God) will finally judge as unbelievers.

### HOW DOES [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) EXPLAIN ABIDING (John 15:7–10)?

38. [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) explains what it means for him to abide in believers.
    The difference between verses 4 and 7 is significant: “Abide in me, and I in you” (v. 4) and “If you abide in me and my words abide in you” (v. 7, emphasis added).
    “My words” (v. 7) explains “I in you” (v. 4).
    (See fig.
    3.11.)
    [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) resides in believers when his specific utterances reside in believers (cf. 6:63).
    [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) rebuked [Philip](bk.#Philip.1) in 14:10, “Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?
    The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells [from [μένω](lemma.lbs.el.μένω)] in me does his works.”
    The Father resides in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) in that his words reside in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus).
    We can’t fully understand how the Father and Son relate to each other, but their relationship illustrates how [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) resides in believers, namely, through his words (cf. 8:31).
39. [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) explains the result of his abiding in believers: “ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
    By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples” (vv. 7\_\_8).
    When believers internalize [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ individual utterances, they will make scripturally informed requests, and [God](bk.#God) will answer them (cf. 14:13–14).
    The fruit in this context is the answers to those prayers (v. 8).
    Bearing much fruit in this way glorifies [God](bk.#God) the Father and shows that you are [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ disciple.
40. [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) explains what it means for believers to abide in him.
    The difference between verses 4 and 9 is significant: “Abide in me” (v. 4) and “Abide in my love” (v. 9).
    The second command further specifies what “Abide in me” means, and verse 10 clarifies what it means to abide in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ love: “If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love.”
    [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) abides in believers when his words abide in them, and believers abide in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) when they obey his words.
    Abiding in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) is obeying [Jesus](bk.#Jesus): “Whoever keeps his commandments abides in [God](bk.#God), and [God](bk.#God) in him” (1 **\_**3:24).
    Thus, “Abide in me, and I in you” (v. 4) means “Obey my words, and let my words remain in you.”
    (See fig.
    3.11.)
    Fig.
    3.11.
    Explaining 15:4 with 15:7, 9–10
    “Abide in me” = Obey my words
    “I in you” = Let my words remain in you
    v. 4
    “Abide in me”
    “and I in you”
    v. 7
    “If you abide in me”
    “and my words abide in you”
    vv.
    9–10
    “Abide in my love.
    If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love”
    [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) abides in you to the degree that his words abide in you, and you abide in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) to the degree that you obey his words.
    Every believer abides in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) to some degree, and that results in different degrees of fruitfulness.
    # CHAPTER 4
    Nine More Reasons Higher Life Theology Is Harmful
    The number one reason higher life theology is harmful is its disjunction it creates two categories of Christians.
    That reason alone is a sufficient reason to reject it.
    Yet there are at least nine more reasons it is harmful (which we label as reasons 2–10 below).
    ## REASON 2. A FORM OF [PERFECTIONISM](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief)
    It Portrays a Shallow and Incomplete View of Sin in the Christian Life
    Higher life theology does not advocate Christian perfection like Wesleyan [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) does, but it is still a form of [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) because its view of sin in the Christian life is shallow and incomplete.
    The Welsh preacher [Martyn Lloyd-Jones](bio.DavidMartynLloydJones) labeled higher life theology as “Psychological [Perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief).”
    ### HOW CHRISTIANS SHOULD DEAL WITH SIN
    There are at least three main views on how Christians should deal with sin:
41. Instantly eradicate sin.
    This is [Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1)’s Christian [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) (see “Wesleyan Perfectionism: Perfect Love toward [God](bk.#God) and Humans” in chap.
    1).
42. Continuously counteract sin.
    This is higher life theology (see “Day 1.
    The Diagnosis: Sin” in chap.
    2).
43. Kill sin as the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) gradually transforms you and restores [God](bk.#God)’s image in you.
    This is a process that [God](bk.#God) does not complete until he glorifies you.
    The process is not uniformly gradual it may include growth spurts and backsliding.
    This is the Reformed view of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) (see fig.
    3.8).
    The key issue is what happens to the whole person.
    If you are a Christian, does your sinful part remain completely unchanged until [God](bk.#God) glorifies you?
    Or does [God](bk.#God) transform your whole person so that you progressively though not completely triumph over sin?
    That raises a controversial issue: What is the sinful “part” of a Christian? ### OLD SELF VS. NEW SELF; OLD NATURE VS. NEW NATURE
    Before you became a Christian, your “old self” was in [Adam](bk.#Adam) and served sin ( 6:6; 3:9; cf.
    4:22).
    As a Christian, your “new self” is in [Christ](bk.#Christ) and serves [Christ](bk.#Christ) ( 3:10; cf.
    4:24).
    Neither “old self” nor “new self” refers to a part of you; it refers to your whole person.
    Your old self had only one nature, but your new self is more complex.
    Does a Christian have one nature or two?
    It depends on how you define nature.
    If you define nature as a complex of attributes, then it makes sense to distinguish your sinful nature from your new nature.
    The one-nature and two-nature views are practically identical because both acknowledge a conflict between “two opposing somethings principles, desires, urgings, etc.” in the Christian.
    Two-nature advocates call them natures.
    One-nature advocates describe these two aspects of the Christian’s one nature as “two struggling principles,” “two opposed sorts of desire,” or “contrary urgings.” ### THREE PROBLEMS WITH HOW HIGHER LIFE THEOLOGY VIEWS SIN IN THE CHRISTIAN
    Problem 1: Higher life theology misunderstands the nature of the flesh.
    The problem with higher life theology is not that it refers to two natures in a Christian but that it incorrectly understands the flesh to be an equally powerful nature alongside the believer’s new nature.
    According to higher life theology, both natures are unchanging entities within the Christian, and only one is in total control at any given moment.
    Thus, the flesh either controls the believer, or the Spirit is counteracting the flesh.
    A Christian in “category 1” (see fig.
    2.3) lives “in the flesh.”
    It is all or nothing.
    A Christian is either “in the flesh” or “in the Spirit.”
    The two natures are two opposing principles that vie for supremacy, like two fierce dogs: if a Christian feeds the good dog and starves the bad dog, then the good dog wins.
    Christians in “category 1” feed their flesh, which dominates their life and produces a fleshly lifestyle.
    For Christians in “category 2,” the Spirit counteracts their sinful nature with the result that they prevail over all known sin.
    The NT uses [σάρξ](lemma.lbs.el.σάρξ) ( , “flesh”) in many different senses.
    The flesh is the realm in which non-Christians live ( 7:5; 8:4, 9; 2:3; 1 2:15–16).
    Christians do not live in the flesh in that sense because people who live in the flesh fail to inherit the kingdom of [God](bk.#God) ( 5:19–21).
    But Christians battle against the flesh ( 5:16–17, 24; cf. 1 \_**\_2:11).
    The flesh is not like a dog that the Christian can weaken and possibly kill by starving it, nor is the flesh an equal opponent to the Spirit, who opposes the flesh and ultimately triumphs over it.
    Rather, the flesh is the Christian’s sinful disposition, and the Christian and the Spirit progressively mortify its sinful deeds.
    Problem 2: Higher life theology rejects that the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) gradually transforms the whole Christian.
    Higher life theology teaches that Christians must continuously counteract sin.
    It views a Christian as having two natures that cannot improve.
    But the Spirit does not merely counteract sin in you without dealing with the sin principle.
    The Spirit transforms your whole person not just one part of you.
    You become increasingly holy and less sinful as the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) enables you to kill sin.
    Problem 3:
    Higher life theology has a low view of sin.
    “Wrong views about holiness are generally traceable to wrong views about human corruption.”
    Higher life theology teaches that you can be free of known sin, but that is “an imperfect perfection, perfect only to the Christian’s consciousness.”
    Sin is not limited to sinful actions that you are aware of: “Sin is lack of conformity to the moral law of [God](bk.#God), either in act, disposition, or state.”
    The human heart is deceitful and desperately sick beyond cure ( 17:9).
    And the more you mature as a Christian, the more sensitive you will become to how sinful you are.
    The more holy you become, the more you will see your sin.
    [Paul](bk.#Paul) himself increasingly realized his own sinfulness, referring to himself as “the least of the apostles” (1 \_\_**15:9), then “the very least of all the saints” ( 3:8), and finally, “the foremost” of “sinners” (1 \_\_\_\_1:15).
    Although all believers experience “a real and genuine (actual) victory, it is a qualified victory” because it does not consist in victory over all known sin.
    “Reformed theologians … constantly affirm that the Christian’s best works are never so good that his conscience ceases to tell him that they could and should have been better.”
    ## REASON 3. A FORM OF [QUIETISM](bk.%Quietism_Belief)
    It Emphasizes Passivity, Not Activity
    Higher life theology’s quietism is evident in the slogan “Let go and let [God](bk.#God),” which “is the essence of the teaching.”
    The “let” idea emphasizes passivity and discourages activity.
    Victorious Christian living is “the Christ-life,” in which [Christ](bk.#Christ) literally lives a Christian’s life for that Christian.
    [Frances Havergal](bio.FrancisHavergal)’s hymn “Church of [God](bk.#God), Beloved and Chosen” captures that passivity with the phrase “Holiness by faith in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus), not by effort of my own.”
    [Quietism](bk.%Quietism_Belief) … holds that all initiatives on our part, of any sort, are the energy of the flesh; that [God](bk.#God) will move us, if at all, by inner promptings and constraints that are recognizably not thoughts and impulses of our own; and that we should always be seeking the annihilation of our selfhood so that divine life may flow freely through our physical frames.…
    Passivity means conscious inaction in this case [i.e., with higher life theology], inner inaction.
    A call to passivity conscientious, consecrated passivity has sometimes been read into certain biblical texts, but it cannot be read out of any of them.
    The New Testament teaches that Christians are responsible to actively pursue holiness:
44. Progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) involves a lifelong struggle.
    “The desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do” ( 5:17; see 5:16–26).
    “The passions of the flesh,” asserts [Peter](bk.#Peter), “wage war against your soul” (1 \_\_\_\_2:11).
45. Progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) requires active effort.
    Christians must become what they are.
    All Christians are saints in the sense that they are already holy (definitive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification)), and [God](bk.#God)’s holy people must become holy (progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification)).
    (See fig.
    4.1.)
    Fig.
    4.1.
    Illustrations of How Christians Must Become What They Are
    What You Are
    Become What You Are
    “We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin” ( 6:6)
    “So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to [God](bk.#God) in [Christ Jesus](bio.JesusChrist)” ( 6:11)
    “you who were once slaves of sin … having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness” ( 6:17–18)
    “present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to [sanctification](bk.%sanctification)” ( 6:19)
    “To the church of [God](bk.#God) that is in [Corinth](bk.@Corinth), to those sanctified in [Christ Jesus](bio.JesusChrist), called to be saints” (1 \_**\_1:2); “[God](bk.#God)’s temple is holy, and you are that temple” (1 \_\_**3:17); “your body is a temple of the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) within you” (1 \_**\_6:19)
    The gospel requires [God](bk.#God)’s holy people to mature in purity (1 Corinthians); e.g., “So glorify [God](bk.#God) in your body” (1 \_\_**6:20)
    “as you really are unleavened” (1 \_**\_5:7 )
    “Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump” (1 \_\_**5:7 )
    “as many of you as were baptized into [Christ](bk.#Christ) have put on [Christ](bk.#Christ)” ( 3:27)
    “put on the Lord [Jesus Christ](bio.JesusChrist)” ( 13:14 )
    “those who belong to [Christ Jesus](bio.JesusChrist) have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires” ( 5:24)
    “make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires” ( 13:14 )
    [Paul](bk.#Paul) portrays the Christian life as warfare ( 6:10–18; 1 \_**\_6:12).
    “Walking is one of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s favorite metaphors for spirituality” (cf. 6:4; 8:4; 2 \_\_**5:7; 5:16; 5:2; 1:10), and it is “an excellent metaphor for the Christian life because it implies progress, continual movement, and the development of strength.”
    [Packer](bio.jipacker) is right: “The Christian’s motto should not be ‘Let go and let [God](bk.#God)’ but ‘Trust [God](bk.#God) and get going!’ ”
    But while higher life theology is a form of quietism, it is also …
    ## REASON 4. A FORM OF PELAGIANISM
    It Portrays the Christian’s Free Will as Autonomously Starting and Stopping [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification)
    Pelagianism exalts a human’s autonomous free will and inherent ability to obey any of [God](bk.#God)’s commands apart from [God](bk.#God)’s help.
    It rejects that humans are totally depraved and affirms that human responsibility (ought) necessarily implies ability (can).
    In other words, if [God](bk.#God) commands humans to do something (e.g., “repent and believe” or “be perfect”), then humans must possess the inherent ability to obey that command without [God](bk.#God)’s help.
    Higher life theology is not pure [Pelagianism](bk.%Pelagianism_Belief), which is [heresy](bk.%heresy).
    But higher life theology is a form of [Pelagianism](bk.%Pelagianism_Belief) because one factor decisively determines whether a Christian is in category 1 or 2 (see fig.
    2.3): It ultimately depends on the Christian’s free will.
    So ultimately, Christians are in control of their [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
    Their will is decisive in starting and stopping progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
    In reply:
46. Your will is not autonomously free.
    Your will is free only in the sense that you are free to act according to your nature.
47. You work because [God](bk.#God) works.
    According to higher life theology, [God](bk.#God) does all the work, and you are passive with one crucial condition: You must choose to let [God](bk.#God) work.
    That is why higher life theology is simultaneously both quietistic and Pelagian-like.
    It encourages Christians to view [God](bk.#God) as a power tool that they just plug in so that [God](bk.#God) does all the work.
    This is the Achilles heel of higher life theology: When a Christian is in category 2 (see fig.
    2.3), who is responsible when that person sins [Christ](bk.#Christ) or the Christian?
    No one would say [Christ](bk.#Christ); it must be the Christian.
    But once a Christian surrenders himself completely to the indwelling [Christ](bk.#Christ), he still has the inherent ability to un-surrender himself and take control back!
    Otherwise [Christ](bk.#Christ) would be responsible for the Christian’s sin.
    The Christian’s free will, therefore, autonomously and decisively starts and stops [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
    [Lloyd-Jones](bio.DavidMartynLloydJones) logically concludes that according to higher life theology,
    The most important factor in [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is the abiding of the believer rather than the keeping power of [Christ](bk.#Christ).
    In other words man according to this view, and in spite of the phrase “let go and let [God](bk.#God),” seems to play the most vital part in the process, for, without his abiding, [Christ](bk.#Christ) cannot keep him.
    Placing such ultimate control in the Christian, argues [Warfield](bio.BenjaminWarfield), resembles both [Pelagianism](bk.%Pelagianism_Belief) and magic and thus dishonors [God](bk.#God).
    [Packer](bio.jipacker) agrees that higher life theology replaces “Pelagian activism” with “Pelagian quietism” and is “little better than magic.”
    According to the New Testament, “The [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) uses my faith and obedience (which he himself first works in me) to sanctify me,” but according to higher life theology, “I use the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) (whom [God](bk.#God) puts at my disposal) to sanctify myself.”
    Thus, higher life theology “is not merely unscriptural; it is irreligious.
    …
    It is Pelagian; for, in effect, it makes the Christian the employer, and the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit) the employee, in the work of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).”
    Progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) “is inevitable, though it is not automatic; it involves our ‘responsible participation.’ ” Although you participate, [God](bk.#God), who began the process, is the one who energizes you and guarantees that he will complete what he began.
    You work because [God](bk.#God) works: “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is [God](bk.#God) who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure” ( 2:12–13).
    [God](bk.#God)’s working in us is not suspended because we work, nor our working suspended because [God](bk.#God) works.
    Neither is the relation strictly one of co-operation as if [God](bk.#God) did his part and we did ours so that the conjunction or coordination of both produced the required result.
    [God](bk.#God) works in us and we also work.
    But the relation is that because [God](bk.#God) works we work.
    All working out of salvation on our part is the effect of [God](bk.#God)’s working in us, not the willing to the exclusion of the doing and not the doing to the exclusion of the willing, but both the willing and the doing.…
    The more persistently active we are in working, the more persuaded we may be that all the energizing grace and power is of [God](bk.#God).…
    [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is the [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) of persons, and persons are not machines.
    ## REASON 5. MISREADING
    It Does Not Interpret and Apply the Bible Accurately
    Higher life theology misinterprets and misapplies the Bible.
    Here are three examples:
48. It assumes that the [Greek](bk.%GreekLanguage_Language) aorist tense-form indicates point-in-time action, especially with reference to proof texts for the crisis of consecration (e.g., 6:13; 12:1).
    That is an exegetical fallacy.
    Standard [Greek](bk.%GreekLanguage_Language) grammars as well as recent studies on verbal aspect deny that the aorist tense-form must or even usually refers to point-in-time action, affirming instead that the aorist tense-form is the default tense that communicates in the most general way possible.
49. It interprets the Bible allegorically, especially in narrative literature, to make theological points regarding the Christian life.
    Instead of expounding the great New Testament texts, they so often started with their theory and illustrated it by means of Old Testament characters and stories.
    You will find that so often their texts were Old Testament texts.
    Indeed their method of teaching was based on the use of illustrations rather than on exposition of Scripture.
    An inevitable result was that they virtually ignored everything that had been taught on the subject of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) during the previous eighteen centuries.
    That is not merely my statement.
    Many of them boasted of this.
    For example, [Harford-Battersby](bk.%ThomasHarfordBattersby_Person), cofounder of the [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People), converted to “the deeper life” when he heard a sermon on 4:46–50 that distinguished between the nobleman’s “seeking faith” (category 1) and “resting faith” (category 2).
50. It emphasizes experience at the expense of doctrine.
    [Robert Pearsall Smith](bio.robertpsmith_1) helped set this tone when he led a higher life meeting: “We did not come to [Oxford](bk.@Oxford) to set each other right, or to discuss doctrines.”
    [Hannah Whitall Smith](bio.hannahwhitallsmith) uses the same tone by opening her most influential work which addresses the deeply theological issue of progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) with a disclaimer that downplays theology and appeals to experience.
    One Keswick historian explains,
    Keswick is interested in the practical application of religious truth rather than in doctrinal or dogmatic theology.…
    The [Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) is not interested in academic discussions of theology and ethics, or even in adding to the store of Bible knowledge of those who attend, but simply and only in helping men to be holy.
    “Perhaps this,” responds [Packer](bio.jipacker), “is the very unconcern that has caused the trouble.
    After all, Pelagianism is the natural heresy of zealous Christians who are not interested in theology.”
    Pitting doctrine against devotion is a false dichotomy because [God](bk.#God) intends them to go together.
    They are not mutually exclusive; one without the other is incomplete.
    Truth is truth proportionally; what you emphasize and deemphasize is significant.
    Higher life theology emphasizes that Christians should be holy.
    That is good.
    But it errs primarily by emphasizing a crisis of consecration and [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) that chronologically separates justification and progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
    That is the essential message of higher life theology, and it neither proportionately nor accurately reflects what the New Testament teaches about Christian living.
    ## REASON 6. FALSE ASSURANCE
    It Assures Spurious “Christians” They Are Saved
    Higher life theology undermines the doctrines of perseverance and assurance by dividing Christians into two distinct categories.
    But all genuine Christians persevere in the faith.
    That is, genuine Christians can neither totally nor finally fall away from trusting [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) ( 8:31; 3:14; 1 **\_**4:15; 5:1), affirming sound doctrine ( 7:17; 1:22–23; 1 **\_**4:6), or doing good works ( 10:27; 2:10).
    Christians continue or persevere to the end.
    The warning passages in Scripture are [God](bk.#God)-ordained means for believers to persevere.
    Both believers and unbelievers must beware of false faith ( 7:21–23; 1 \_\_\_\_9:27).
    All genuine Christians persevere, but not all of them have assurance and some non-Christians have false assurance.
    If you have assurance, you are convinced that you have eternal life that you are a born-again Christian.
    And you can have different degrees of assurance (see fig.
    4.2).
    Fig. 4.2.
    Degrees of Assurance
    Non-Christian
    ?
    Christian
51. Strong evidence of unbelief
52. Weak evidence of unbelief
53. Mixed evidence of unbelief and faith
54. Weak evidence of faith
55. Strong evidence of faith
    Should have no assurance to a stronger degree than #2
    Should have no assurance to a weaker degree than #1 and a stronger degree than #3
    Should have no assurance to a weaker degree than #2
    Should have assurance to a weaker degree than #5
    Should have assurance to a stronger degree than #4
    Strong degree of no assurance
    Strong degree of assurance
    The question mark in the middle column indicates that we simply cannot know whether such a person is a Christian.
    They may profess to be a Christian, but they should not have assurance that they are a Christian because the evidence is mixed.
    The basis of assurance is objective: It is based solely on [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s finished cross-work as the word of [God](bk.#God) reveals.
    The means of assurance is subjective: You can know you are a Christian by the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit)’s ongoing work in your life (e.g., 8:14–17) and by your persevering in the faith (e.g., 1 John).
    A major problem with higher life theology is that rather than causing professing Christians to examine themselves to see whether they are genuine Christians persevering in the faith (2 \_\_\_\_13:5), it exhorts them to move from category 1 to category 2 (see fig.
    2.3).
    A disastrous result of dividing Christians into those two distinct categories is that higher life theology can have a comforting, soothing effect on professing Christians who are not actually genuine Christians.
    Such a person might think, “I’m a carnal Christian, not a spiritual Christian.
    But I’m still on my way to heaven.”
    Higher life theology gives such a person false assurance.
    A spurious “Christian” should not have assurance that they have eternal life.
    For example, if a sinful lifestyle characterizes you such as unrepentantly indulging in pornography or immoral sex then you should question whether you are really a Christian.
    Furthermore, if a person identifies as a “carnal Christian” in category 1, on what basis can a church excommunicate a so-called brother or sister?
    To have two classes of Christians makes the biblical commands to exercise church discipline difficult or impossible to apply.
    If Christians walk exactly like non-Christians, then the only way we could distinguish Christians from non-Christians would be by their profession of faith, not by their life.
    Yet Scripture makes clear that we are to exercise discipline on the basis of the walk of professing believers.
    ## REASON 7. METHODOLOGY
    It Uses Superficial Formulas for Instantaneous [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification)
    The sermons and writings that employ higher life theology often have multistep formulas.
    For example, what are the conditions for experiencing [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit)?
    • [Evan Hopkins](bio.evanhopkins_1) gives four steps.
    • [J. Elder Cumming](bio.jeldercumming) gives three steps.
    • [F. B. Meyer](bio.fbmeyer_2) gives five conditions.
    • [Andrew Murray](bio.AndrewMurray.1) gives two conditions in one book, four steps in another, and seven steps in another.
    Such formulas are superficial because they are not the result of carefully reading and explaining the New Testament.
    The formulaic approach is common probably because it appeals to people who want simple applications and instant victory over sin.
    They deeply want to be more holy, and they are impatient with their struggle against sin and want [God](bk.#God) to deliver them from that struggle now.
    Superficial formulas seem like the recipe they are looking for a shortcut to instantly conquering sin.
    ## REASON 8. ADDICTION
    It Fosters Dependency on Experiences at Special Holiness Meetings
    The [Keswick Convention](bk.%KeswickConvention_People) saw itself as a spiritual clinic for Christians, but many of the same patients consistently returned year after year.
    One reason for that cycle is that Christians who embraced higher life theology became addicted to what they experienced at special holiness meetings.
    They made short-lived commitments in emotionally charged atmospheres like the adult version of so-called “camp decisions” by young people.
    [Higher life theology] tends to make people dependent upon meetings and the particular atmosphere of certain meetings.
    Having surrendered at first in the highly charged emotional atmosphere of a meeting, and having received the blessing, they subsequently seemed to lose it, and were unable to regain it until they found themselves once more in the same atmosphere.
    This process is repeated several times and often leads to a type of life strangely comparable to that of an electric battery which constantly runs down and has to be re-charged by a dynamo.
    Religious meetings and gatherings are invaluable aids to the Christian life, but when we live by them and become entirely dependent upon them and begin to think that we must wait for them before we can live the Christian life as we ought to live it, they become the very snare of the devil.
    This phenomenon also repeats itself in public invitations or “altar calls” that some preachers regularly give to Christians at the end of a sermon.
    The same tender-hearted Christians often respond repeatedly to such appeals, developing a mindset that real [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) takes place when you publicly “walk the aisle” for “reconsecration” or “rededication.”
    That approach can be counterproductive because it does not train Christians to pursue steady, progressive growth through the [means of grace](bk.%meansOfGrace) such as Bible intake, prayer, worship, [evangelism](bk.%evangelism), serving, and stewardship.
    ## REASON 9. ABUSE
    It Frustrates and Disillusions the Have-Nots
    Higher life theology ultimately disillusions believers in their progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) because it presents an unattainable standard.
    It’s impossible for us to live free from sin.
    Christians who follow higher life theology mainly because they deeply desire to be holy often become frustrated and dangerously disillusioned.
    And that can result in brutal experiences.
    Such Christians may morbidly introspect and repeat “an endless cycle that looks something like the following”:
56. I need to be victorious.
57. If I consecrate myself, I will be victorious.
58. I now consecrate myself.
59. I am not victorious; therefore, I did not consecrate myself sufficiently.
60. Go back to number one.…
    DYSFUNCTIONAL LIVING:
    In the final analysis, Christians who remain in the Higher Life “syndrome” must eventually distort reality.
    The truth is that they are not victorious over sin and that they are not all that holy.
    If they refuse to accept this fact, they must redefine such things as sin, righteousness, maturity, repentance, revival, and even the Gospel itself.
    Moreover, their view of themselves must continually be skewed.
    That can be the start of serious mental and emotional disaster.
    Christians must live and walk in truth about [God](bk.#God) and themselves.
    [God](bk.#God) uses different means to rescue his disillusioned people from higher life theology.
    For me, that included counsel and preaching from pastors (especially [Mike Harding](bio.mikeharding_1) and [Mark Minnick](bio.markminnick_1)) and books and articles by theologians both dead (especially [Martyn Lloyd-Jones](bio.DavidMartynLloydJones), [John Murray](bio.JohnMurray), [John Owen](bio.JohnOwen), [J. C. Ryle](bio.jcryle), [B. B. Warfield](bio.BenjaminWarfield)) and alive (especially [D. A. Carson](bio.DACarson), [William Combs](bio.williamwcombs), [Sinclair Ferguson](bio.sinclairbfergusonedavidfwright_1), [Wayne Grudem](bio.wayneagrudem_1), [John MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur), [Rolland McCune](bio.rollandmccune), [J. I. Packer](bio.jipacker), and [John Piper](bio.johnpiper)).
    For [Albert Martin](bio.albertmartin), it was [J. C. Ryle](bio.jcryle)’s Holiness.
    For [J. I. Packer](bio.jipacker), it was [John Owen](bio.JohnOwen).
    [Packer](bio.jipacker)’s testimony is moving.
    Higher life theology frustrated the tender-hearted [Packer](bio.jipacker) as a young, recent convert when he pursued holiness.
    “It didn’t work,” [Packer](bio.jipacker) recounts, “and that was a deeply frustrating and depressing thing.
    It made me feel like a pariah, an outsider, and at the age of eighteen that was pretty burdensome.
    In fact, it was driving me crazy.”
    He testifies, “The reality of [higher life theology’s] passivity program and its announced expectations, plus its insistence that any failure to find complete victory is entirely your fault, makes it very destructive.
    I know this; I have been at the receiving end of it.”
    [Packer](bio.jipacker) felt like a “poor drug addict” desperately, unsuccessfully, and painfully trying “to walk through a brick wall.”
    The explanation for his struggle, according to higher life theology, was his “unwillingness to pay the entry fee,” that is, he didn’t fully consecrate himself.
    “So all he could do was repeatedly reconsecrate himself, scraping the inside of his psyche till it was bruised and sore in order to track down still un-yielded things by which the blessing was perhaps being blocked.”
    His confusion, frustration, and pain grew as he kept “missing the bus.”
    The pursuit was as futile as chasing a “will-o’-the-wisp.”
    He felt like “a burned child” who “dreads the fire, and hatred of the cruel and tormenting unrealities of overheated holiness teaching remains in his heart to this day.”
    [Packer](bio.jipacker) concludes that higher life theology is depressing because it fails to eradicate any of the Christian’s sin, and it is delusive because
    it offers a greater measure of deliverance from sin than Scripture anywhere promises or the apostles themselves ever attained.
    This cannot but lead either to self-deception, in the case of those who profess to have entered into this blessing, or to disillusionment and despair, in the case of those who seek it but fail to find it.
    Higher life theology fosters elitism among Christians.
    It schismatically divides Christians into the haves and the have-nots those who experientially know the secret and those who do not.
    And that leaves the have-nots frustrated and disillusioned.
    ## REASON 10. SPIN
    It Misinterprets Personal Experiences
    The previous nine critiques of higher life theology raise an important question: How do you explain it when [God](bk.#God) transforms Christians who testify that higher life theology is the cause?
    The answer is not to deny that [God](bk.#God) genuinely transformed them.
    The answer is that such people theologically misinterpret their personal experiences.
    Some believers take such a large step of growth at one time that they remember it for years.
    The error is in calling that large step of growth a once-for-all-time “crisis” that enables “real” progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) to begin.
    Some believers experience multiple large steps of growth, and others experience more gradual steps.
    A helpful analogy to this is eating.
    Do you remember every meal you’ve ever eaten?
    That’s impossible.
    But you can probably recall some of them.
    One of my most memorable meals occurred on December 6, 2008, at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse.
    I had just finished a week of exhausting comprehensive exams at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and my wife and I decided to use a gift card at some restaurant I had never heard of.
    I didn’t know steak could taste that good!
    You may remember for years certain meals that you have eaten, but you cannot remember most of the meals you have eaten.
    That does not mean that you have failed to eat meals consistently; it means that some meals were more memorable than others.
    Similarly, as Christians mature, some steps of spiritual growth may be more memorable than others.
    You may find Christians at every stage of this process, for it is a process through which all must pass; but you will find none who will not in [God](bk.#God)’s own good time and way pass through every stage of it.
    There are not two kinds of Christians, although there are Christians at every conceivable stage of advancement towards the one goal to which all are bound and at which all shall arrive.
    Furthermore, some who hear higher life theology do not process all the theological inaccuracies.
    Instead, they benefit when the teaching emphasizes relying on [Christ](bk.#Christ) instead of relying on yourself.
    [God](bk.#God) is very gracious and truly gives himself to all who truly seek him (see 29:13; 10:34–35), never mind whether their theology is good or not so good.…
    The devotional conclusion is that when Christians ask [God](bk.#God) to make them more like [Jesus](bk.#Jesus), through the Spirit’s power, he will do it, never mind what shortcomings appear in their theology.
    He is a most gracious and generous [God](bk.#God).…
    So should we give higher life theology a pass?
    I agree with [Packer](bio.jipacker):
    Does any of this justify the inaccuracies of Keswick teaching?
    No.
    It is not much of a recommendation when all you can say is that this teaching may help you if you do not take its details too seriously.
    It is utterly damning to have to say, as in this case I think we must, that if you do take its details seriously, it will tend not to help you but to destroy you.
    # Conclusion
    Bad theology dishonors [God](bk.#God) and hurts people.
    That’s why I wrote this book evaluating higher life theology.
    I love [God](bk.#God), and I don’t want higher life theology to hurt people.
    Higher life theology hurt me, and it has hurt many others.
    Don’t let that happen to you!
    I almost gave this book a title that was too long like an old-school Puritan title: Why “Let Go and Let [God](bk.#God)” Is a Bad Idea: or, Why Higher Life Theology’s Quick Fix to Your Struggle with Sin Will Not Result in a Higher Life, Deeper Life, Victorious Life, More Abundant Life, or Anything Other Than a Misguided, Frustrated, Disillusioned, and/or Destroyed Life.
    But I settled on a more concise title: No Quick Fix.
    Higher life theology is a quick fix that doesn’t work.
    Higher life theology is commendable in some ways, but its harmful features far outweigh its positive ones:
61. It creates two categories of Christians.
62. It portrays a shallow and incomplete view of sin in the Christian life.
63. It emphasizes passivity, not activity.
64. It portrays the Christian’s free will as autonomously starting and stopping [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
65. It does not interpret and apply the Bible accurately.
66. It assures spurious “Christians” they are saved.
67. It uses superficial formulas for instantaneous [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
68. It fosters dependency on experiences at special holiness meetings.
69. It frustrates and disillusions the have-nots.
70. It misinterprets personal experiences.
    There is a better way.
    See the appendix: “A More Excellent Way: Recommended Resources on the Christian Life.”
    I highlight resources for further study that avoid the harmful elements of higher life theology and will feed your soul and stir your affections for our glorious [God](bk.#God).
    But first, don’t miss the afterword that concludes this book.
    [John MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur) has been faithfully teaching the Bible and critiquing higher life theology for about fifty years.
    I asked him if he would be willing to tell his own story regarding higher life theology (including the so-called [“Lordship salvation” controversy](bk.%LordshipSalvationControversy)) and evoke the joy and freedom of moving away from it and helping others do the same.
    [John](bio.johnamcarthur_1) graciously agreed.
    His afterword creates an effective one-two punch with how I critique higher life theology in part 2, and it nicely bookends my own story in the introduction.
    # Afterword by [John MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur)
    I was not raised on Reformed theology; far from it.
    I was raised under the influence of higher life theology without the title.
    Until I reached seminary, an uncritical acceptance of the various forms of this deceptive and frustrating credo was what I thought of as Christianity.
    Every Sunday, the post-sermon invitation the preacher gave included a call to dedication, rededication, consecration, or surrender.
    The assumption was clearly that there were two kinds of Christians: lower-level believers and those who had decided to give themselves more fully to the Lord.
    Believers who entered into this advanced level of commitment would shift from being carnal to being spiritual.
    They would thus enter into a state of almost effortless victory over sin and temptation.
    Every guest preacher at our revival meetings, the annual Bible conference, and especially youth camp would end his talk with a passionate call for those who were just Christians to give up everything and follow the Lord.
    Often, if not always, camp ended with an invitation to rededicate our lives and demonstrate seriousness by coming to the front of the campfire meeting and throwing a stick in the fire.
    The stick was supposed to be the symbol of a life given fully to the Lord.
    There was lots of drama, some tears, and earnest hope that this act would be transformational.
    But those things inevitably were followed in a few days by frustration as the same struggle for holiness and victory began exactly where it left off before camp.
    My beloved Dad, a faithful pastor and preacher, had filled the shelves of his study library with all the higher-plane, deeper-life, Keswick devotional authors (whom [Naselli](bio.andrewdavidnaselli) identifies in this book).
    They provided much material for his sermons, with the same emphasis, though somewhat muted.
    We all believed that praying a prayer of faith settled salvation.
    When a life didn’t change, there was the need for consecration the leap to the next level, where spirituality became sort of automatic as you “let go and let [God](bk.#God)” work by yielding to an unusual empowering by the [Holy Spirit](bk.#GodTheSpirit).
    While still in high school, I was unsuccessfully chasing that elusive spiritual moment of surrender.
    I even read Imitation of [Christ](bk.#Christ) by [Thomas à Kempis](bio.ThomasKempis) and Power through Prayer by [E. M. Bounds](bio.EdwardBounds), searching for the doorway to full victory in my conflict with sin.
    Deeper-life writers often used language with gnostic overtones promising to reveal “the secret of victorious living” or “the key to a deeper life.”
    But I was not experiencing the victory that I thought I was supposed to.
    I was desirous of doing right and honorably did want to serve the Lord.
    But I was certain that I fell short of what the Lord desired and deserved.
    I spent years in pursuit of the mysterious formula that would instantly launch me onto that higher plane of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
    A few years at a legalistic Christian college didn’t help.
    I was active in ministry there, but found that keeping external rules for the sake of appearance cannot restrain the flesh.
    I saw that building a pious veneer with manmade rules actually produces hypocrisy.
    Under the surface of strict legalism and sanctimonious formality, there is always much evil.
    I left the school still looking for that true experience.
    A violent, near-deadly automobile accident while in college put me in bed for months.
    I tried to draw on that trial as motivation to move up (higher) or down (deeper).
    I did learn that my life was not mine to control and that I needed to be far more serious with the things of the Lord, but I still wasn’t sure how to get where I needed to be.
    During my student days, [Campus Crusade for Christ](bio.campuscrusadeforchrist_1) launched at UCLA and drew its theological breath from the brand of higher life teaching that separates the lordship of [Christ](bk.#Christ) from the gospel.
    Crusade mass-produced and distributed two booklets.
    One was a booklet on how to be saved, and the other was a booklet on how to be sanctified.
    Both were simplistic, formulaic fast-track steps to get the desired result.
    With the first book, you could become a carnal Christian.
    The second book told you how to become a spiritual Christian.
    The influence of Crusade was global.
    They popularized higher life teaching with tens of thousands of young people.
    The influence of Crusade drove a large number of young men out of secular universities into Dallas Theological Seminary.
    Dallas Seminary was the academic bastion of this two-part view of salvation.
    That seminary made the view of the carnal Christian and the spiritual Christian seem doctrinally and intellectually acceptable.
    I experienced this kind of theology firsthand when I was invited twice to the seminary to do a week-long preaching series.
    Some years later when I understood more precisely how pervasive this teaching was and what damage it was doing, I decided to write some books targeting the error.
    I responded in particular to published works written by members of the faculty at Dallas Seminary.
    My books were entitled The Gospel according to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus) and The Gospel according to the Apostles.
    This year will bring the publication of the third book in that series The Gospel according to [Paul](bk.#Paul).
    All three books were born out of my concern for the confusion and deception spread by the errors of “no-lordship salvation.”
    On the personal side, I had several friends in high school, college, and seminary professing Christians headed toward Christian ministry who radically defected from the faith to engage in the pursuit of false religion, atheism, and immorality.
    I struggled to believe that they were low-level, carnal, unsanctified Christians still on their way to heaven, as those who advocate no-lordship doctrine would affirm.
    With all this swirling in my mind, I chose to write my master’s thesis in seminary on [Judas Iscariot](bk.#Judas).
    I wanted to understand the condition of the defector versus that of a true believer.
    There in seminary for the first time I began to read Reformed theology and the Puritans.
    I also became serious about exegeting Scripture.
    In the years after seminary, I continued to look back through my life and consider how many people I knew in my Dad’s churches who identified as Christians, and yet their lives gave no evidence of genuine faith.
    I thought about friends of the family, relatives, board members, fellow students, youth ministers, and people in the congregations I had attended.
    Over the years I had known many dozens of people who claimed to be Christians but whose behavior and values were indistinguishable from my unbelieving neighbors.
    They lacked any evidence of grace in their lives.
    Most evangelicals had long since come to the point of embracing such “carnal Christians” as legitimate Christians despite their utter lack of any commitment to [Christ](bk.#Christ).
    They assumed such people just needed to surrender to the Spirit.
    Evangelists like [Billy Graham](bio.BillyGraham) had convinced thousands of aisle-walkers they were saved by that act of response.
    But only a miniscule percentage of them ever united with any church after the meetings ended.
    Their names may have gone to a church, but their bodies never followed.
    In February 1969, this concern about true salvation led me to choose 7:21–23 as the text for my inaugural sermon as pastor of Grace Community Church.
    I gave the same warning to the church that our Lord gave at the end of his [Sermon on the Mount](bk.%SermonOnTheMountplain) that many who claim to be Christians don’t have a saving relationship with him at all.
    Such will be condemned to hell while claiming to have worked in his name.
    That sermon launched a kind of revolution among comfortable false Christians and true Christians who thought the issue was a matter of a second blessing.
    Since that first Sunday, the tone and emphasis of my ministry has always been to make clear that there is only one kind of Christian: a person who has been justified and is being sanctified.
    True believers are transformed at conversion, and their lives manifest the presence and power of their Lord.
    [Sanctification](bk.%sanctification) begins at justification meaning there is no such thing as a fundamentally carnal, incorrigibly disobedient Christian who refuses to surrender to [Christ](bk.#Christ) as Lord.
    No issue has been more important in my studying, writing, preaching, and leading than understanding and making known the biblical truth that [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) begins when a person is truly converted, and not at some later point when a “carnal Christian” finally decides to surrender more fully to [Christ](bk.#Christ).
    The higher life, deeper life, “let go and let [God](bk.#God)” Keswick doctrine in all its forms drains the truth from the biblical doctrines of regeneration and [sanctification](bk.%sanctification).
    It degrades the doctrine of regeneration by allowing unsanctified false believers to think they are saved when their lives declare that they are not.
    It mutilates the doctrine of [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) and thereby allows sanctified true believers to think they are not being sanctified although their lives and the word of [God](bk.#God) declare that they are.
    In other words, the deeper-life doctrine is a lie that deceives both true believers and people who falsely profess faith in [Christ](bk.#Christ).
    A right understanding of salvation and [sanctification](bk.%sanctification) is the foundation of true gospel faith.
    Certainly nothing has been more important to me in my spiritual pilgrimage than being delivered from those early misunderstandings into the clear truth of Scripture.

    # APPENDIX: A More Excellent Way: Recommended Resources on the Christian Life
    After critiquing Wesleyan [perfectionism](bk.%Perfectionism_Belief) and higher life theology, [Martyn Lloyd-Jones](bio.DavidMartynLloydJones) issued a convicting challenge:
    The things about which [[George Whitefield](bio.GeorgeWhitefield) and [John Wesley](bio.JohnWesley.1)] agreed were more important, and they had much fellowship together during the last years of [Whitefield](bio.GeorgeWhitefield)’s life.
    We must follow these men.
    There are these differences, and we must be clear about them.
    But let us examine ourselves.
    It is easy to denounce false holiness teaching; but what is your holiness teaching?
    Have you the same desire for holiness?
    These men suffered, and sacrificed much in order to be holy men.
    They may have been confused about doctrines at times, they may have confused “things that differ,” but they were zealously concerned to be holy men of [God](bk.#God), and many of them were concerned to have a holy and a pure church.
    There, we surely are with them, and agree with them; and if we criticize what they taught, let us make sure that we have, and can preach and practice, “a more excellent way.”
    I don’t want to end this book solely on a negative this-is-why-that-view-is-wrong note.
    There is a more excellent way, and I want to point you to resources for further study.
    These resources avoid the destructive elements of higher life theology and will help you fan the flame of holiness that [God](bk.#God) keeps ablaze in your heart.
    This prayer is a good place to start: “Father, please make me as holy as a saved sinner can be.”

78. [Grudem, Wayne](bio.wayneagrudem_1).
    Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine.
    [Grand Rapids](bk.%GrandRapids_Place): Zondervan, 1994.
    Well-organized, easy-to-understand, usually persuasive, and devotional.
    See especially the chapters on progressive [sanctification](bk.%sanctification), [Spirit-baptism](bk.%baptismOfTheSpirit), and [Spirit-filling](bk.%fillingOfTheHolySpirit) (pp. 746–87; see also 788–809, 840–50).
    There are also two shorter versions of [Grudem](bio.waynegrudem)’s systematic theology: the middle-level version is called Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith (ed.
    [Jeff Purswell](bio.jeffpurswell); 1999), and the most condensed version is called Christian Beliefs: Twenty Basics
    Every Christian Should Know (ed.
    [Elliot Grudem](bio.elliotgrudem); 2005).
    [Grudem](bio.waynegrudem) is currently preparing a second edition that should make his outstanding Systematic Theology even better.
    See also [Grudem](bio.waynegrudem)’s “Free Grace” Theology: 5 Ways It Diminishes the Gospel (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2016).
    [Grudem](bio.waynegrudem)’s theology is sound, and his tone is just right.

    [Grand Rapids](bk.%GrandRapids_Place): Eerdmans, 1989.
    See chap.
    12: “[Sanctification](bk.%sanctification)” (pp. 192–233; see also 19–27, 47–67, 234–56).

    [Stanley N. Gundry](bio.stanleyngundry), Counterpoints ([Grand Rapids](bk.%GrandRapids_Place): Zondervan, 1987), 61–90.
80. [Keller, Timothy](bio.timothykeller).
    Books, articles, sermons, interviews, etc.
    [Keller](bio.timothykeller) masterfully applies the Bible.
    He penetratingly analyzes the culture and explains the views of his opponents in a disarming way.
    Here are six highlights: (1) The Prodigal [God](bk.#God): Recovering the Heart of the Christian Faith ([New York](bk.@NewYorkCity): Dutton, 2008).
    Both brothers in [Jesus](bk.#Jesus)’ famous parable rebelled, “but one did so by being very bad and the other by being extremely good” (p. 36).
    Elder-brother types “obey [God](bk.#God) to get things.
    They don’t obey [God](bk.#God) to get [God](bk.#God) himself” (pp.
    42–43).
    (2) Counterfeit [God](bk.#God)s: The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power, and the Only Hope That Matters ([New York](bk.@NewYorkCity): Dutton, 2009)
    what our idols are, how to discern them, and how to remove and replace them.
    Books 3–6 are probably the best all-around on those subjects: (3)
    The Meaning of Marriage: Facing the Complexities of Commitment with the Wisdom of [God](bk.#God) ([New York](bk.@NewYorkCity): Dutton, 2011).
    (4) Every Good Endeavor: Connecting Your Work to [God](bk.#God)’s Work ([New York](bk.@NewYorkCity): Dutton, 2012).
    (5) Walking with [God](bk.#God) through Pain and Suffering ([New York](bk.@NewYorkCity): Dutton, 2013).
    (6) Prayer: Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with [God](bk.#God) ([New York](bk.@NewYorkCity): Dutton, 2014).
81. [Mahaney, C. J.](bio.cjmahaney) Living the Cross-Centered Life: Keeping the Gospel the Main Thing.
    Sisters, OR: Multnomah, 2006.
    Refreshing truths.
    You never graduate from the gospel as if that is merely the ABCs of Christianity.
    It’s the very heart of Christian living.

    (See the section “[Charles C. Ryrie](bio.CharlesRyrie)” in chap.
    1 above.)
    See also two of [MacArthur](bio.johnfmacarthur)’s other books on this issue: The Gospel according to [Jesus](bk.#Jesus): What Is Authentic Faith?, 3rd ed.

    Edited by [Kelly M. Kapic](bio.kellymkapic) and [Justin Taylor](bio.justintaylor).

    Responsibly updates the archaic language of [Owen](bio.JohnOwen)’s classic works on how Christians mortify sin and how to understand temptation and indwelling sin.
    See also [Matthew Barrett](bio.matthewbarrett) and [Michael A. G. Haykin](bio.michaelaghaykin), Owen on the Christian Life: Living for the Glory of [God](bk.#God) in [Christ](bk.#Christ), Theologians on the Christian Life (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2015).

92. [Piper, John](bio.johnpiper).
    Books, articles, sermons, interviews, etc.
    Most are available for free at www.desiringGod.org.
    I suggest starting with [Piper](bio.johnpiper)’s signature book: Desiring [God](bk.#God): Meditations of a Christian Hedonist, pages 11–359 in vol.

    # Acknowledgments
    I’m grateful for friends who insightfully commented on the more detailed and academic version of this book: Let Go and Let [God](bk.#God)?
    A Survey and Analysis of Keswick Theology (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2010).
    Many thanks to friends who gave me feedback on this more popular-level book, especially [Abigail Dodds](bio.abigaildodds_1), [Tom Dodds](bio.tomdodds_1), [Andrew Johnson](bio.andrewjohnson), [Charles Naselli](bio.charlesnaselli_1), [Nate Weller](bio.nateweller_1), [Jonathon Woodyard](bio.jonathonwoodyard_1), and my teaching assistant, Matt Klem, who also prepared the indexes.
    I’m grateful to my church’s school, Bethlehem College & Seminary, for encouraging and empowering me to research and write in order to spread a passion for the supremacy of [God](bk.#God) in all things for the joy of all peoples through [Jesus Christ](bio.JesusChrist).
    Most significantly, my excellent wife, Jenni, has been supportive, interested, and sacrificial as I have researched higher life theology.
    This book’s dedication page makes me smile every time I think about it: “To Jenni, my second blessing.”

What shall we say then?
Are we to continue in sin
that grace may abound?
By no means!
How can we who died to sin still live in it?
Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his DEATH?
We were buried therefore with him by baptism into DEATH,
we too might walk in newness of life.
in order that, just as Christ was raised from the DEAD by the glory of the Father,
For if we have been united with him in a DEATH like his,
we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
We know that our old self was CRUCIFIED with him
in order that the body of sin might be BROUGHT TO NOTHING,
so that we would no longer be ENSLAVED TO sin.
For one who has DIED has been SET FREE FROM sin.
Now if we have DIED with Christ,
we believe that we will also live with him.
We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never DIE again;
DEATH no longer HAS DOMINION OVER him.
For the DEATH he DIED he DIED to sin, once for all,
but the life he lives he lives to God.
So you also must consider yourselves DEAD to sin
and alive to God
in Christ Jesus.
Let not sin therefore REIGN in your mortal body,
to MAKE YOU OBEY its passions.
Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness,
but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from DEATH to life,
and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.
For sin will HAVE NO DOMINION OVER you,
since you are not under LAW
but under grace.
What then?
Are we to sin
because we are not under LAW
but under grace?
By no means!
Do you not know that
if you present yourselves to anyone as OBEDIENT SLAVES,
you ARE SLAVES OF THE ONE WHOM YOU OBEY,
either of sin, which leads to DEATH,
or of OBEDIENCE, which leads to righteousness?
But thanks be to God,
that you who were once SLAVES OF sin
have become OBEDIENT from the heart
to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,
and, having been SET FREE FROM sin,
have become SLAVES OF righteousness.
I am speaking in human terms,
because of your natural limitations.
For just as you once presented your members as SLAVES TO impurity
and TO lawlessness leading to more lawlessness,
so now present your members as SLAVES TO righteousness leading to sanctification.
For when you were SLAVES OF sin,
you were FREE in regard to righteousness.
But what fruit were you getting at that time
from the things of which you are now ashamed?
For the end of those things is DEATH.
But now that you have been SET FREE FROM sin
and have become SLAVES of God,
the fruit you get leads to sanctification
and its end,
eternal life.
For the wages of sin is DEATH,
but the free gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Yet among the mature we do impart WISDOM,
although it is not a WISDOM of this age
or of the rulers of this age,
who are doomed to pass away.
But we impart a secret and hidden WISDOM of God,
WHICH God decreed
before the ages
for our glory.
None of the rulers of this age understood THIS,
for if they had,
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But, as it is written,
“What no eye has seen
nor ear heard,
nor the heart of man imagined,
what God has prepared for those who love him”
these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit.
For the Spirit searches everything,
even the depths of God.
For who knows a person’s thoughts
except the spirit of that person,
which is in him?
So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God
except the Spirit of God.
Now we have received not the spirit of the world,
but the Spirit who is from God,
that we might understand the things freely given us by God.
And we impart this in words not taught by human WISDOM
but taught by the Spirit,
interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.
The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God,
for they are folly to him,
and he is not able to understand them
because they are spiritually discerned.
The spiritual person judges all things,
but is himself to be judged by no one.
“For who has understood the mind of the Lord
so as to instruct him?”
But we have the mind of Christ.
But I, brothers,[e] could not address you
as spiritual people,
but as people of the flesh,
as infants in Christ.
I fed you with milk,
not solid food,
for you were not ready for it.
And even now you are not yet ready,
for you are still of the flesh.
For while there is jealousy and strife among you,
are you not of the flesh
and behaving only in a human way?
For when one says, “I follow Paul,”
and another, “I follow Apollos,”
are you not being merely human?
spiritual person: submits to Christ as both Savior and Lord; may at times live like a “carnal” person in some areas; inevitably grows through means of grace.
