# Preface

The variety of views in biblical studies presents a maze of complexity.
There are often as many interpretations as interpreters.
With the Lexham Research Commentaries, we start from the premise that the best solution is to provide a map of the maze.
The series is designed to be a research tool.
Each guide presents a wide range of interpretive issues raised by Bible scholars.
These resources meet the needs of those studying the Bible in academic settings, but the broad scope of coverage also makes them useful for preaching preparation.
The research engages with critical biblical scholarship and explains scholarly interpretations.
Undoubtedly you will agree with some interpretations, disagree with others, and encounter some for the first time.
Whatever the case, these are issues you will run across.
We’re here to guide you through this rough terrain.
Each volume in the series links to standard scholarly works on the Bible.
The authors of the Research Commentaries have made no attempt to identify where particular interpretations fall along the theological or denominational spectrum.
This is a mark of the diversity of biblical interpretation, not a mark of implicit endorsement by the guides’ authors.
Interpreters from different theological perspectives often have conflicting views on the same texts.
As you encounter these views, we urge you to keep the biblical text itself central to your study.
The Research Commentaries provide the information you need to reach your own conclusions.
Our summary will explain the issue and the main options.
The annotated links will point you to a variety of resources that engage the issue in more depth.
If all you need is an overview, the guide alone will give you easy access to the essential information.
If you need to research a passage in depth, we will point you to the most relevant discussions among the thousands of available resources in the Logos library.
Research takes time.
The Research Commentaries save time.

# Introduction to [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing)

## Message

[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s main message to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) is to treat [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) as a brother in [Christ](bk.#Christ) ( 16).
The letter centers on the return of the slave, [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1), to his master, [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).
[Paul](bk.#Paul) knows that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) has every right as a slave owner to punish [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) harshly since he ran away.
[Paul](bk.#Paul) therefore appeals to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) as a Christian to receive [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) not as a mere slave, but as a brother in [Christ](bk.#Christ) ( 16).
In short, the call of the letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) is for Christians to let the theology of the gospel justification by faith for all who believe, both Jew and Gentile to radically reshape how they relate to other people.
In the case of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), this means taking [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back not as a slave to be punished, but a brother in [Christ](bk.#Christ) and, possibly, as one freed from slavery.

## Themes

At the heart of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s message to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) is his belief that the gospel of [Jesus Christ](bio.JesusChrist) has the power to reconcile all people in [Christ](bk.#Christ) even master and slave.
Elsewhere in his letters, [Paul](bk.#Paul) writes about the gospel as a message of reconciliation (e.g., 2 \_**\_5:17–21; 1:18–20); in [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing) we see [Paul](bk.#Paul) putting this message into practice by trying to unite [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1).
[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s involvement in their reconciliation points to a second theme of the letter sacrificial love for fellow brothers and sisters in [Christ](bk.#Christ).
This is seen in [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s gratuitous offer to cover any outstanding costs on [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ behalf ( 18).
As [Wright](bio.ntwright) 1986,\_193–4) notes in his commentary, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s actions in the letter echo his description of [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s sacrifice in 2 \_\_**5:17–21 just as [Christ](bk.#Christ) took on our sins to make reconciliation with [God](bk.#God) possible, in [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), [Paul](bk.#Paul) reconciles “master and slave by taking on himself the role of [Christ](bk.#Christ).”
Finally, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) implicitly deals with [God’](bk.#God)s providence and His ability to use all things to accomplish His plan ( 15).

## Genre

[Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing) not only belongs to the genre of Graeco-Roman letters it typifies the basic structure of the genre.
It opens with a standard greeting ( 1–3) followed by a thanksgiving section ( 4–7).
The body of the letter, which includes [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s main message to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and his household, is next ( 8–22).
The letter then concludes with [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s greetings ( 23–24) and a brief farewell ( 25).

## Composition

Virtually all scholars agree that [Paul](bk.#Paul) is the author of [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing) (see [Ehorn](bio.sethmehorn) 2011 on [Baur](bio.FerdinandBaur)’s argument against Pauline authorship).
[Timothy](bk.#Timothy) may have functioned as a co-author or co-sender of the letter.
The date of the letter depends on the background to the letter.
Those who think [Paul](bk.#Paul) wrote [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing) while imprisoned in [Ephesus](bk.@Ephesus) tend to date the letter to around AD 55–56 (see [Davids](bio.peterhdavids) 2008, 417–8).
Those who suggest that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s imprisonment was in Caesarea date the letter later, to around AD 57–59 (see 23:23–26:32), though this view is uncommon (see the discussion in [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) 1996, 307–8).
Lastly, those who believe [Paul](bk.#Paul) wrote [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) from a prison in Rome date it to the early AD 60s (see 28:14–31; [Garland](bio.davidegarland) 1998, 307–8).

## Historical Setting

[Paul](bk.#Paul) wrote this letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), a slave owner who came to the faith through [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s ministry ( 19).
[Paul](bk.#Paul) also mentions [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) and [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) as well as [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s house church ( 2).
Scholars debate whether [Paul](bk.#Paul) addressed the letter to these people as well or wrote to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) alone (see [Davids](bio.peterhdavids) 2008, 418–20).
The letter is closely associated with [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letter to the [Colossians](bible+esv.72).
Both letters name [Timothy](bk.#Timothy) as a co-sender ( 1:1; 1), mention Epaphras ( 1:7; 23) and [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) ( 4:17; 2), and include similar names in their respective greetings ( 4:10; 24).
Furthermore, in 4:9, [Paul](bk.#Paul) explicitly refers to [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) as a resident of [Colossae](bk.@Colossae), which implies [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) lived there too.
It is therefore plausible that [Paul](bk.#Paul) both wrote and sent [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing) and [Colossians](bk.%EpistleToTheColossians_Writing) together.
The historical circumstances behind the letter are essential to interpreting its contents.
While in prison, [Paul](bk.#Paul) converted a runaway slave named [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) whose owner, [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), [Paul](bk.#Paul) also brought to the faith.
In accordance with Roman law, Paul now sends [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back to his master along with a carefully crafted letter in which he appeals to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to accept [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back as a brother in [Christ](bk.#Christ) and, possibly, to grant him freedom.

# [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s Letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)

1–25

## Overview

[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) is formatted like a classic letter of antiquity.
[Paul](bk.#Paul) opens with a standard greeting in 1–3, introducing himself (along with [Timothy](bk.#Timothy)) as the author and addressing his audience [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1), [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1), and [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s house church.
After this, he offers a thanksgiving to [God](bk.#God) in which he prays for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s love and faith ( 4–7).
In the main body of the letter, [Paul](bk.#Paul) appeals to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) on behalf of his slave, [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1), both of whom [Paul](bk.#Paul) converted to the faith ( 8–22).
[Paul](bk.#Paul) roots his request regarding [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) in love rather than command.
He asks [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to welcome [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back not just as his slave, but as his brother in [Christ](bk.#Christ), even suggesting that [God](bk.#God) orchestrated their separation for this very purpose ( 15–16).
To remove any potential hindrances to their reconciliation, [Paul](bk.#Paul) offers to cover any outstanding costs that may have resulted from [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ running away ( 19).
[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s extra request to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) in 21 presents him as it does modern readers with the letter’s most perplexing question: Did [Paul](bk.#Paul) ask for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to release [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) from slavery?
[Paul](bk.#Paul) concludes the letter by anticipating that he will visit after he is released from prison ( 22).

## Place within the Canon

[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) represents one of many passages in the Bible that address how masters ought to treat their slaves.  
 15:12–15 instructs slave owners to release their Hebrew slaves after six years of work and to help them upon their release.
This command is based on the paradigmatic story of slavery in the Bible the enslavement of the Israelites in the land of Egypt.
In the OT, the exodus narrative serves as the ethical basis of Israel’s treatment of its slaves (e.g., 20:2; 5:15; 24:18).
The Mosaic law also includes injunctions that protect both male and female slaves from being kidnapped or excessively abused (e.g., 21:16, 20–21; compare 1 \_**\_1:8–10).
In the NT, the “household codes” in the letters of [Paul](bk.#Paul) and [Peter](bk.#Peter) provide instructions to both masters and slaves on how to behave as a Christian (see 6:5–9; 3:22–4:1; 1 \_\_**2:18–25).
[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s instructions to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), like a majority of passages dealing with slavery in the Bible, do not condemn the institution of slavery.
At the same time, [Paul](bk.#Paul) does not celebrate the master-slave relationship as a Christian ideal.
One could argue that by urging [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to allow his brother-brother relationship with [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) to take precedence over their master-slave relationship, [Paul](bk.#Paul) depicts the sibling-in-Christ identity as the ultimate human relationship.

## Starting Point

The institution of slavery in Graeco-Roman society, including the practices of manumission, is the key background issue to [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing).
The following resources provide an overview of slavery in the ancient world with an eye to its importance for studying the NT.

## [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) and [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1)

Although [Paul](bk.#Paul) probably addressed the letter only to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) (“our dear friend and co-worker”), he mentions two other individuals in his salutations: [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) and [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) (see [O’Brien](bio.petertobrien) 1998,\_273).
He also provides brief descriptions for both of these people he calls [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) “our dear sister” and [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) “our fellow soldier.”
Despite these descriptions, it remains difficult to determine the identity of [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) and [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) and their relationship to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).
Many scholars, including [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) 1971,\_190), regard [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) as [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s wife since her name immediately follows [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s in the text and, possibly, because wives were partially responsible for dealing with the slaves of their household.
As for [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1), scholars often identify him as a family member most commonly as a son of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) (see [Hendriksen](bio.williamhendriksen) 1964,\_210–11).
Others, including [Rupprecht](bio.arthurrupprecht) 2006,\_636), suggest [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) was not related to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).
Attempts to determine his identity are only complicated by [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s reference to [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) as “our fellow soldier” and his mention of him in 4:17.
• [Baugh ](bio.stevenmbaugh)notes that the identification of [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) as [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s wife goes back to early Christian tradition, though this conclusion is not certain.
He adds that [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) may have been [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s ministry partner in Colossae and the son of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1).
[Baugh](bio.stevenmbaugh) suggests that if this understanding of [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) is correct, it would help confirm Colossae as the destination of the present letter as well as the resident city of [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing).
2” Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary: Romans to [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing)
• [Bird](bio.michaelfbird) argues that [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1), regardless of her relationship to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), may be addressed in the letter because she was “the primary overseer” of slaves in her household and because she may have held “some formal office” in the house church that is addressed in 2.
He regards [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) as a “fill-in pastor” in Colossae during [Epaphras](bk.#Epaphras.1)’ absence (see 4:17).
1–7” A New Covenant Commentary: Colossians and [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing)
• [Bruce](bio.FFBruce) espouses the most common position on this issue by identifying [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) and [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) as the wife and son of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), respectively.
He further notes that the name [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) was a well-known name at the time and that the name of one “[Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) of Colossae” can be found on a tombstone next to her husband [Hermas](bk.#Hermas.1)’ name.
2” NICNT:
The Epistles to the Colossians, to [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing) and to the Ephesians
• In [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn)’s view, [Paul](bk.#Paul) mentions [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) not simply because she was [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s wife but because, as the woman of the household, she would have had as much interest in “the [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) affair” as her husband.
He offers two further notes regarding [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1).
First, the reference to [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) as “the sister” (tē adelphē) could imply that she was [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s unmarried sister.
[Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) considers it more likely, however, that her description as “the sister” denotes her Christian faith.
Second, he claims the designation of [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1) as “the sister” notable since the noun is rarely found in its feminine form in the NT as it is here suggests “that a serious attempt was made … to treat women as individuals and as Christians in their own right.”
Concerning [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1), [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) claims the tradition of [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) being [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s son owes more to legend than history.
He instead interprets [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) in terms of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s description of him as a “fellow soldier” (systratiōtēs), which he claims describes the dedicated and independent nature of [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1)’ ministry.

Like most commentators, [Fitzmyer](bio.josephfitzmyer) regards [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) to be the same person mentioned in 4:17 as a participant in [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s ministry.

Instead, [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) regards [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) as “a fellow combatant” of [Paul](bk.#Paul) who, as a leader of the community, should “be informed of what [Paul](bk.#Paul) expects of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).”

As an example of other views of [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1)’ identity, [Patzia](bio.arthurgpatzia) draws attention to the theory proposed by [John Knox](bio.JohnKnox) that [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) not [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) is the master of [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1).

[Thompson](bio.mariannemeyethompson) regards [Archippus](bk.#Archippus.1) as a co-worker of [Paul](bk.#Paul)s rather than the son of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and [Apphia](bk.#Apphia.1).

## The Fellowship of Your Faith

One of the most difficult exegetical issues in Philemon is the translation and interpretation of the phrase “the fellowship of your faith” (hē koinōnia tēs pisteōs sou; 6).
The word koinōnia means “fellowship” or “partnership.”
It occurs just three times in the Septuagint ( 5:21; 3 **\_**4:6; 8:18 LXX) but appears 19 times in the NT, including 13 times in [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letters (e.g., 2:42; 15:26; 1 \_**\_10:16; 2 \_\_**6:14; 2:9; 1:5; 1:6; 13:16; 1 **\_**1:3). [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn)  
 1996,\_318–9) suggests [Paul](bk.#Paul) may be responsible for bringing the term into the vocabulary of early Christianity, where it often refers to the “mutual participation” between Christians on the basis of their shared identity in [Christ](bk.#Christ) (see [Wright](bio.ntwright) 1986,\_180–2).
In 6, the term appears with another common word in the NT, “faith” (pistis).
Commentators debate not only the precise meaning of each of these terms within their context, but their grammatical relationship to each other (i.e., should tēs pisteōs be taken as a subjective or objective genitive?). [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo)  
 2008,\_390–2) identifies four different interpretations of the phrase among commentators and translations.
First, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s prayer could concern [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s participation with [Paul](bk.#Paul) in the Christian faith or ministry (see TNIV, NET).
In this case, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s prayer in 6 would be understood as anticipating his later request to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) as the means by which their “fellowship” would become effective.
Second, it could refer to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s “sharing” of the Christian faith in an evangelistic sense (see KJV, NRSV).
Third, [Paul](bk.#Paul) may be praying that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s fellowship with other believers which has faith as its basis would be effective (see [Wright](bio.ntwright) 1986,\_183).
Fourth, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s prayer may refer to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s “act of fellowship,” that is, his generosity and sharing with others (see NLT; [O’Brien](bio.dlynnobrienhallstein_2) 1998,\_279–81).
For [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo)’s own interpretation, see below.
• According to [Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke), the ambiguity of the phrase is intentional.
They suggest that the “manifold” meanings of the phrase hē koinōnia tēs pisteōs should not be regarded as mutually exclusive.
They claim that no English translation is yet to capture the variegated meaning of the Greek of the phrase, though “faith communion” represents the best option.
6” The Eerdmans Critical Commentary: The Letter to Philemon: A New Translation with Notes and Commentary
• [Bruce](bio.FFBruce) interprets this phrase as a reference to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s sharing of his resources out of his faith in [Christ](bk.#Christ).
In this sense, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s prayer is an invitation to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to experience “the knowledge and enjoyment” of the blessings believers have in [Christ](bk.#Christ) through sharing, or having “fellowship,” with fellow Christians.
6” NICNT:
The Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon and to the Ephesians
• Against [Bruce](bio.FFBruce), [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) argues that [Paul](bk.#Paul) is referring to a subjective experience of the Christian faith, not of generosity or sharing resources.
He also suggests that the primary way in which [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) (and his church) could experience this is by reading and responding to [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letter.

• [Ehorn](bio.sethmehorn) helpfully lists seven English translations to demonstrate the numerous interpretations of 6.

6” The Evangelical Exegetical Commentary: Philemon
• [Larson](bio.knutelarson) seems to understand [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s prayer to be concerned with [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s sharing of his Christian faith, though he says that this does not imply [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing) wasn’t already doing so.
He suggests [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s hope is for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to integrate life and belief in his daily affairs and personal relationships.
6” Holman New Testament Commentary: I & II Thessalonians, I & II Timothy, Titus, Philemon
• [Martin](bio.ralphpmartin) suggests that the aim of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s prayer is for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s generosity to others to result in the release of [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1).
However, his commentary lacks the in-depth exegesis necessary to establish this view with any degree of certainty.
4–7” Interpretation: Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon
• As noted above, [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo)’s commentary includes a survey of the major interpretive positions taken by scholars.
[Moo](bio.douglasjmoo) himself claims that koinōnia always has an active meaning in [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letters.
Accordingly, he prefers the translation “fellowship based on faith.”
He also claims that the word koinōnia is central to the letter’s purpose [Paul](bk.#Paul) desires for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1), bound together by their faith in [Christ](bk.#Christ), to “think through the radical implications of their koinōnia.”
6” The Pillar New Testament Commentary: Colossians and Philemon
• [Rupprecht](bio.arthurrupprecht) interprets this “unusually difficult” Greek phrase to mean that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s prayer is for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s fellowship of the faith to become effective by his knowledge of [God](bk.#God)’s goodness.
To support this view, he appeals to 1:9–10, which also implies that knowledge precedes good works.

• [Thomson](bio.mariannemeyethompson) accurately sums up the problematic nature of this verse by noting that virtually every word in the prayer can have multiple meanings and is subject to numerous interpretations.
In her view, [Paul](bk.#Paul) is not referring to evangelism, but to the believer’s mutual participation in “a greater reality” of [Christ](bk.#Christ) through faith that “leads to deeper understanding and experience” of the “rich blessings” that belong to those in [Christ](bk.#Christ).

## What Is Required

In 8, [Paul](bk.#Paul) writes that he is bold enough to command [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to do “what is fitting” or “what is required” (to anēkon).
Yet [Paul](bk.#Paul) then says he would rather appeal to him on the basis of love ( 9).
In other words, [Paul](bk.#Paul) desires for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to act out of his own volition, not out of obligation or compulsion.
What is less obvious for readers is what [Paul](bk.#Paul) considers “fitting” for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to do.
The verb anēkō can mean “to be fitting” or “to be right.”
Elsewhere in the NT, [Paul](bk.#Paul) exhorts wives to submit to their husbands “as is fitting” (hōs anēken) in the Lord ( 3:18).
In 5:4, [Paul](bk.#Paul) uses the term in a negative sense to suggest that various forms of inappropriate speech are “not fitting” (ouk anēken) for believers (see different uses of the term in 22:14; 1 \_\_\_**10:40 LXX).
Scholars also discuss [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s reason for referring to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s duties as “what is required.”
For example, [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) 1971,\_198) regards [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s required task as his Christian duty in contrast to a general moral obligation.
Similarly, [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) 1996,\_325–6) suggests [Paul](bk.#Paul) is appealing to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s duty “in [Christ](bk.#Christ)” that is, to his responsibilities and obligations that were “transformed” after he became a Christian.
On the whole, recent scholars agree that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s plea is for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to willingly fulfill his obligation as a Christian brother to [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) rather than being required to do so (see 14).
• [Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) offer a lengthy discussion of previous interpretations of the notion of “fitting.”
These include the use of similar terms in Greek moral-philosophical literature (e.g., [Cicero](bio.mtulliuscicero) and [Horace](bio.horace)) and the argument that anēkon should be understood as “duty.”
They reject both of these interpretations; instead, they claim that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s expression, “commanding the proper thing,” is a paradox [Paul](bk.#Paul) cannot command [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to do what is “fitting” out of his own volition.
They conclude that for [Paul](bk.#Paul) to say “do what is fitting” means to do the will of [God](bk.#God) (compare 2 **\_\_\*\*1:6; 5:3; 6:1–3; 3:18; 4:1).
8–9” The Eerdmans Critical Commentary: The Letter to Philemon: A New Translation with Notes and Commentary
• [Bird](bio.michaelfbird) interprets the verse primarily in a moral sense.
He suggests that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s hope is for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to not act out of “spite, anger, or as a grieved slave owner,” but out of love as [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ master and as a Christian.
8” A New Covenant Commentary: Colossians and Philemon
• According to [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn), the “interesting” term to anēkon generally refers to “the obligation one owes to some constitutive principle which gives shape and meaning to existence.”
Along these lines, he suggests that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) may have been legally obligated as a prominent person in Colossae to deal with [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) in a strict fashion to set an example of punishment.
However, [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) prefers to interpret to anēkon as an appeal to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s Christian obligations and responsibilities.
8” The New International Greek Testament Commentary: The Epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon
• [Fitzmyer](bio.josephfitzmyer) notes that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s appeal to “what is required” is at home in the world of Greek legal language as well as in the terminology of Hellenistic philosophy.
But in his view, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s appeal is not a legal one.
He claims that “what is proper” is what [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) should do as a Christian.
[Paul](bk.#Paul) spells this out in 10–13.
8” Anchor Yale Bible: Letter to Philemon
• As noted above, [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) distinguishes between a general moral obligation that is, what all people are required to do and a Christian’s duty.
He suggests [Paul](bk.#Paul) expects [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to do “what is fitting” in the latter sense.
This Christian “duty,” [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) adds, is “made concrete” in the following verses as [Paul](bk.#Paul) urges [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to treat his slave as a brother and act out of Christian love.
8” Hermeneia: Colossians and Philemon
• [Melick](bio.richardrmelickjr) understands to anēkon to mean “what is proper” within “the Christian order of things.”
By this he means that certain things are “inherently right” within “[God](bk.#God)’s economy,” which includes treating a brother in [Christ](bk.#Christ) fairly and mercifully.
In short, [Melick](bio.richardrmelickjr) understands “what is proper” to mean what is right for the Christian to do in an ethical sense.
8” The New American Commentary: Philippians, Colossians, Philemon
• [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo) argues that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s language here is intentionally “undefined.”
He suggests that [Paul](bk.#Paul) not only hesitates to command [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) “to do what he ought to do,” but also to make clear what course of actions he expected him to take.
Although [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo) thinks [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s obligation is unclear in the passage, he claims [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s Christian status is the reason he is obligated to act in a certain way.
8” The Pillar New Testament Commentary: Colossians and Philemon
• Like the majority of recent commentators, [O’Brien](bio.petertobrien) rejects the argument that to anēkon should be taken in a legal sense (see [Kittel](bio.GerhardKittel), [Bromiley](bio.GeoffreyWBromiley), and [Friedrich](bio.gerhardfriedrich) 1964, 360).
Instead, he interprets the phrase in a general sense as [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s duty as a Christian.
8” Word Biblical Commentary: Colossians, Philemon
• According to [Wall](bio.robertwwall), the clue to understanding the phrase to anēkon is the prepositional phrase “in [Christ](bk.#Christ)” ( 8).
In his view, these words indicate that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s appeal to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) is rooted in [Christ](bk.#Christ), “where [God](bk.#God)’s salvation is shared and where any legal or fraternal obligation [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) feels toward [Paul](bk.#Paul) can only be deepened and secured.”
This primarily religious command then reinforces any possible legal or fraternal obligations that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) may have had.
[Wall](bio.robertwwall) also interestingly suggests that 8 could be a warning to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) that [Paul](bk.#Paul) could order him to fulfill his duty if he doesn’t do so on his own.

# [God](bk.#God)’s Role in [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ Separation

In 9–13, [Paul](bk.#Paul) urges [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to do “what is required” and receive his slave, [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1), as his Christian brother when he returns.
[Paul](bk.#Paul) then pauses to consider whether [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s separation from [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) had been part of [God](bk.#God)’s plan “For perhaps because of this, he was separated from you for a time, in order that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother …” ( 15–16).
At issue here is the interpretation of the verb chōrizō in particular, whether its passive form in 15 implies [God](bk.#God)’s role in [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ separation or, alternatively, a deliberate effort on [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s part to eschew any mention of [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) running away from his master.
As an advocate of the former position, [Wright](bio.ntwright) 1986,\_191) claims [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s language in the passage especially the terms tacha (“perhaps”) and hina (“so that”) obliquely suggests that [God](bk.#God) intended for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) to run away as a slave so that he could “find [Christ](bk.#Christ) for himself” and return to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) as a brother.
Arguing in favor of the latter view, [Vincent](bio.marvinvincent) 1897,\_188) stresses the “tact” of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s language is to avoid describing [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ departure in a manner that would depict him as a runaway slave.
[Vincent](bio.marvinvincent), like most interpreters who share his view, also observes that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s language speaks to [God](bk.#God)’s providence, even if only on a secondary level.
• [Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) conclude that the use of the passive rather than the middle (“he separated himself”) indicates that [Paul](bk.#Paul) wanted to imply [God](bk.#God)’s action in [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ separation from [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).
In their view, [Paul](bk.#Paul) uses a passive construction (passivum divinum) to describe the activity of a third party in their slave-master relationship.
But unlike other places in the letter, [Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) argue, the third part is not [Paul](bk.#Paul) himself but [God](bk.#God), who “reigns over and directs all things and events.”
Their commentary includes an extended discussion of [God](bk.#God)’s omniscient and omnipotent use of all things for His purposes throughout the biblical narrative.
15” The Eerdmans Critical Commentary: The Letter to Philemon: A New Translation with Notes and Commentary
• [Bruce](bio.FFBruce) maintains that the passive verb implies that [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ separation was caused by, or at least “overruled by,” [God](bk.#God)’s providence.
The relationship between [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) and [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) would have eventually come to end whether through emancipation, resale, or death but by [God](bk.#God)’s act their “new and deeper relationship” can go on forever.
15” NICNT:
The Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon and to the Ephesians
• According to [Davids](bio.peterhdavids), [Paul](bk.#Paul) employs a passive verbal construction in 15 as part of his diplomatic suggestion that the separation was due to “divine initiative” and was only intended to last “for a little while.”
15” Cornerstone Biblical Commentary, Volume 16: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 & 2 Thessalonians, Philemon
• [Fitzmyer](bio.josephfitzmyer) argues that echōristhē “has to be understood as a divine passive” and that it connotes [God](bk.#God)’s hidden purpose for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ separation from [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).
According to his commentary, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s rhetoric in 15 is designed to avoid drawing attention to [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ running away and, at the same time, to emphasize the role of divine providence.
Moreover, [Fitzmyer](bio.josephfitzmyer) is one of many commentators to alert readers to the similarities between [God](bk.#God)’s providence in the letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and the story of [Joseph](bk.#Joseph) (see 50:20).
15” Anchor Yale Bible: Letter to Philemon
• Although most commentators observe that echōristhē is likely a divine passive, [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo) is one of few to offer a grammatical argument in favor of this interpretation.
He points out that the verb echōristhē should be regarded as a divine passive because it “governs a purpose clause.”
That is, the purpose of [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ separation is the restoration of the relationship between [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1), an interpretation of 15 that only makes sense if [God](bk.#God) is the acting agent behind the verb echōristhē.
15” The Pillar New Testament Commentary: Colossians and Philemon
• [Wall](bio.robertwwall) notes that in addition to the probable instance of the divine passive in 15, the adverb tacha (“perhaps”) points to God’s involvement in [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ departure.
He suggests that in Jewish literature though he does not provide references (but see [Josephus](bio.FlaviusJosephus), Life 301) tacha sometimes introduces “a theological exposition.”

# Charge This to Me

As [Paul](bk.#Paul) exhorts [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to accept the return of his slave, [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1), he attempts to settle any outstanding issues between them so they can reunite not just as slave and master but as brother and brother.
To this end, [Paul](bk.#Paul) tells [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) that he will take responsibility for anything [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) owed him “If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account” ( 18 ESV).
By virtue of the first-class conditional clause beginning with the conjunction ei, this verse seems to imply that [Paul](bk.#Paul) was aware that [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) wronged his master in some respect (see [Fitzmyer](bio.josephfitzmyer) 2000,\_117).
Alternatively, [Barth](bio.markusbarth) [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) 2000,\_480–81) observe that the conditional sentence may be hypothetical and “describe a simple possibility that is not fixed as a reality.”
Yet [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s offer would be gratuitous if [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) had not done something damaging that Paul was aware of (so [Wright](bio.ntwright) 1986,\_194).
Assuming the conditional clause at the beginning of 18 refers to an actual debt, what did [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) owe [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)?
Each commentator seems to have their own nuanced position on this issue, though their views can be grouped into two basic views.
First, many scholars think [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) stole money from his master to cover his costs as he fled to the city (see [Wright](bio.ntwright) 1986,\_194).
Second, scholars such as [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) 1971,\_204) suggest that [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ debt to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) is “the cost of the damages that resulted from [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ flight.”
In other words, [Paul](bk.#Paul) was willing to pay for the cumulative costs of the labor [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) failed to do in his absence.
It should be noted that both interpretations remain somewhat speculative given the lack of clarity in the text and the uncertainty of how such matters were handled in the ancient world.
• [Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) argue there is no evidence within the letter to support the claim that [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) stole from his master.
They suggest there is better evidence that [Paul](bk.#Paul) is referring to “the damages that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) has suffered through the loss of the work” in [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ absence.
They also bring to attention, but ultimately reject, a third possible meaning: [Paul](bk.#Paul) may be referring to debt or damages that [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) brought into his slavery to “work off.”
17–18” The Eerdmans Critical Commentary: The Letter to Philemon: A New Translation with Notes and Commentary
• [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) argues that 18 deals with more than a hypothetical debt since the letter on the whole implies there was a “serious breach” between [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) and his master.
In his view, [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) caused this breach by stealing or embezzling funds entrusted to him and by running away from [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) since, as a slave, he was the property of his master.

Nonetheless, he notes that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) would have incurred costs from [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ absence as well as from additional slaves hired to carry out his work.

# Did [Paul](bk.#Paul) Ask [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to Release [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)?

Scholars have long debated whether the central request of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letter is for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to release [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) from his status as a slave.
That is, does [Paul](bk.#Paul) request implicitly or directly [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to grant [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) manumission, the act of freeing or liberating a slave?
This question comes to the fore in 21, where [Paul](bk.#Paul) expresses his confidence that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) will be obedient and “will do even more than I say” (kai hyper ha legō poiēseis).
Up to this point in the letter, [Paul](bk.#Paul) has stopped short of asking outright for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ release.
He says he would prefer [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to do “what is required out of love and free will and not because [Paul](bk.#Paul) commanded him ( 8–9).
Yet he does not specify the nature of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s Christian obligation.
In 12–16, [Paul](bk.#Paul) exhorts [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to take [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back as a brother in [Christ](bk.#Christ) and as “more than a bondservant” (hyper doulon).
Yet neither here nor anywhere prior to 21 does [Paul](bk.#Paul) explicitly ask for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ freedom.
Slavery was a significant component of the social and economic culture of the Graeco-Roman world; [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ release from slavery on the basis of his Christian relationship to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) would have been nothing short of extraordinary within its cultural context.
Still, many scholars interpret “even more than I say” as a request for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ release (e.g., see [Saarinen](bio.ristosaarinen) 2008,\_210).
Those who espouse this view often claim that 21 must entail more than sending [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back to [Paul](bk.#Paul) since the apostle has already made known his desire to keep him ( 13). [Barth](bio.markusbarth) [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke)  
 2000,\_492) suggest three nuanced interpretations of the purpose for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ manumission: 1) he is to return to minister with [Paul](bk.#Paul); 2) he is to join the fellowship and administration of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1)’s house church; and 3) he is to return with provision from [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) as a symbol of their new relationship.
A second interpretation of “even more than I say” suggests that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s desire is not for manumission, but for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to treat [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) even better than he has previously requested in the letter.
Scholars who adopt this view stress that [Paul’](bk.#Paul)s primary concern is for the Christian relationship of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1).
Thus, [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) 1971,\_206) remarks that “not a single word [in the passage] is devoted to the question whether the slave should be given his freedom.”
A third major view proposes that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s ambiguous request is for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to send [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back to [Paul](bk.#Paul) for ministry, but not (necessarily) as a freed man (see [O’Brien](bio.petertobrien) 1998,\_305–6). [Hendriksen](bio.williamhendriksen)  
 1964,\_224) briefly proposes several other possible interpretations of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s request.
• [Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) provide a balanced overview of previous interpretations on this issue.
They claim that choosing between these alternative views is “difficult,” though they suggest that the passage itself does not seem to imply manumission.
In their view, the “most obvious” connection in the text, and thus the guiding interpretive piece of data, is the link between 21 and 13.
[Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) contend that taken together, these verses suggest that [Paul](bk.#Paul) desired [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) not only to receive [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) as a brother, but also to send the slave back to him.
Earlier in their commentary they provide an excursus on the question, “Why No Plea for Manumission?”

• [Davids](bio.peterhdavids) stresses that we simply do not know whether [Paul](bk.#Paul) expected [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to manumit [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1).
He says he would like to think that [Paul](bk.#Paul) hoped for manumission, though with admirable candor he confesses that this might be due to his Western sensibilities.
He goes on to suggest that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s greater concern is for how [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) would treat [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) upon his return.
8–22” Cornerstone Biblical Commentary, Vol 16: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 & 2 Thessalonians, Philemon
• According to [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn), “even more” must mean something beyond [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s previous requests to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to receive [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back “forever” ( 17) and to forgive his slave’s debts ( 18).
He suggests the two most likely options are freeing [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) and sending [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back to [Paul](bk.#Paul).
In the end, however, [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) concludes that [Paul](bk.#Paul) intentionally leaves the decision entirely up to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).
21” The New International Greek Testament Commentary: The Epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon
• [Ehorn](bio.sethmehorn) draws attention to the significance of the repeated preposition hyper for the meaning of 21.
In 16, [Paul](bk.#Paul) asked [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to receive [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) as “more” (hyper) than a slave; now he expresses his confidence that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) will do “even more” (kai hyper).
Beyond this, [Ehorn](bio.sethmehorn) claims that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s hopes and expectations are left inexplicit.
Still, he questions interpreters who argue that [Paul](bk.#Paul) hoped for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ manumission, claiming that this view is a “clear option” only for modern readers who read the text through their own cultural context.
21” The Evangelical Exegetical Commentary: Philemon
• [Fitzmyer](bio.josephfitzmyer) claims that “more” could refer to manumission and [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s desire for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) to return to work with him as libertus.
He further notes that the reference to [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) as [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s co-worker in 4:9 which he maintains was written some 15 years after [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) dovetails with this interpretation.
As tantalizing as [Fitzmyer](bio.josephfitzmyer) finds this view, he stops short of espousing it.
Instead he implies that [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s rhetoric is designed to allow [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to decide what to do.

• [Garland](bio.davidegarland) thinks [Paul](bk.#Paul) hopes for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to grant [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) his freedom, even though the apostle never states this explicitly in the letter.
He suggests that [Paul](bk.#Paul) is hopeful and even confident that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) will free his slave to join the apostle’s ministry.

• [Hendriksen](bio.williamhendriksen) considers it “rash” to infer that [Paul](bk.#Paul) must have hoped for [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) to be sent back to him immediately, or for his freedom.
He also draws attention to several other interpretations of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s request, including the possibilities of [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) granting [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) “spare time” for evangelistic work and [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) urging other slave owners to treat their slaves in a better manner.
21” Baker New Testament Commentary: Colossians and Philemon
• [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo) doubts that [Paul](bk.#Paul) wanted [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) sent back to him since 22 states that the apostle wished to visit [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) in Colossae.
Thus, he does not think [Paul](bk.#Paul) is hoping that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) will “assign” [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) for ministry with him.
According to [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo)’s interpretation, 22 reiterates [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s already stated hope for manumission (see 16).
He adds two important caveats to this claim.
First, in the first century, slaves such as [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) would probably be freed at some point; [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s request may be for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) not to delay this event.
Second, slaves remained obligated to their masters even after manumission, hence [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s concern with how [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) treated [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) his slave and now brother in [Christ](bk.#Christ).

• [O’Brien](bio.petertobrien) stands in agreement with [Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) as well as [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) in ruling out manumission as the meaning of “even more.”
In his view, this verse refers to [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s desire for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to return [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) to him for the purpose of “service of the gospel.”

He suggests that what has been hinted at throughout the letter is now made more clear “[Paul](bk.#Paul) wants some ‘[Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1),’ some ‘benefit’ from [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).
[Paul](bk.#Paul) wants his useful helper back.”
20” The Letters to Philemon, the Colossians, and the Ephesians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on the Captivity Epistles

Yet in his view, there is a second purpose alluded to in 21: [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ emancipation, either immediately or when [Paul](bk.#Paul) comes to visit ( 22).
Unlike most commentators, [Wright](bio.ntwright) offers an extended critique of the main alternative viewpoint (not emancipation).

# Key Word Studies

## Desmios, “Prisoner.”

The Greek noun desmios refers to someone in prison or another form of custody.
The NT writers use the term frequently in this sense.
[Matthew](bk.#Matthew.1), for example, calls [Barabbas](bk.#Barabbas.1) a well-known “prisoner” (desmios; 27:16).
The book of Acts uses the term at several points to refer to the imprisonment of various early Christians (e.g., 16:25; 23:18; 25:14; 28:17; compare 13:3).
[Paul](bk.#Paul) often employs the word desmios, along with its cognate noun desmos (“imprisonment” or “chains”), in a two-dimensional sense to refer to his literal captivity and his status as a servant of [Jesus Christ](bio.JesusChrist).
For instance, [Paul](bk.#Paul) describes himself as a “prisoner” (desmios) of [Jesus Christ](bio.JesusChrist) on behalf of the Gentiles ( 3:1; 4:1).
Likewise, [Paul](bk.#Paul) tells [Timothy](bk.#Timothy) to not be ashamed of him as the Lord’s prisoner (desmios; 2 \_\*\*\_1:8).
In the opening of Philippians, [Paul](bk.#Paul) celebrates his “imprisonment” (desmos) as an opportunity to share the gospel ( 1:7, 13–14, 17).
[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s imprisonment plays a key role in his letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), including its beginning, where he introduces himself as a “prisoner” (desmios) rather than an “apostle.”
Despite the brevity of [Philemon](bk.%EpistleToPhilemon_Writing), [Paul](bk.#Paul) uses these cognate terms four times in writing the letter ( 1:1, 9–10, 13). [Barth](bio.markusbarth) [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke)  
 2000,\_243–5) offer four explanations of why [Paul](bk.#Paul) uses prisoner language in the letter: (1) to reveal his humility in anticipation of his request to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1); (2) because he regarded suffering for [Christ](bk.#Christ)’s sake as a cause for joy; (3) to draw a connection between his role as a prisoner and [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ role as a slave; (4) and to present his patience in imprisonment as an example to [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1).

## Achrēstos, “Useless,” and Euchrēstos, “Useful.”

In 8–14, [Paul](bk.#Paul) writes that he is sending [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) back to his master, [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), even though he desired for him to stay.
[Paul](bk.#Paul) was likely worried that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) would treat [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) merely as his slave, so he reminds him of [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ value to him “Formerly he was useless (achrēston) to you, but now he is indeed useful (euchrēston) to you and to me” ( 11 ESV).
The contrasting terms [Paul](bk.#Paul) uses to describe [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ worth, achrēston and euchrēston, are a play on words.
The term achrēston, which occurs only here in the NT, means for something to be without worth or value.
In [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), this term refers to [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1)’ worth after he ran away (and possibly before).
The second term, euchrēston, describes the usefulness or value of a person or thing (see 2 \_\_\*\*2:21; 4:11).
The significance of these terms in 11 goes beyond mere lexical meaning.
As most commentators point out, achrēston and euchrēston may both be a play on words.
First, the name [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) (Onēsimos), a common name for slaves at the time, also means “useful.”
A second pun, which some scholars question (see [Moo](bio.douglasjmoo) 2008,\_409), suggests that achrēstos and euchrēstos resemble, in appearance and sound, the word Christos (“[Christ](bk.#Christ)”). [Wright](bio.ntwright)  
 1986,\_189) aptly sums up the playfulness of [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s language in 11: “[Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) is now in [Christ](bk.#Christ).
And if he is euchrēstos, Christian and ‘useful,’ that means that his relationship with [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), and not just with [Paul](bk.#Paul), will be seen in quite a new light.
He will be ‘[Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1),’ ‘useful,’ both to you and to me.”

## Splanchnon, “Heart.”

This term literally refers to the inward parts of the body (see 1:18), but along with its cognate verb splanchnizomai, it is often used to denote affection or compassion (see 9:36; 8:2; 2 \_\_\_\_6:12; 1:8; 2:1).
[Paul](bk.#Paul) uses the term in the latter sense three times in [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), where it is often translated as “heart.”
In 7, [Paul](bk.#Paul) says that “the hearts” (ta splanchna) of the saints have been refreshed through [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1).
Possibly related here is the description of children as “hearts” (splanchna) in [Artemidorus](bio.daldianusartemidorus_1), Oneir.
1.44 (see [Kittel](bio.GerhardKittel), [Bromiley](bio.GeoffreyWBromiley), and [Friedrich](bio.gerhardfriedrich) 1964, 548).
In 12, [Paul](bk.#Paul) calls [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1), whom he already referred to as his child ( 10), “my heart” (ta ema splanchna).
And in 20, [Paul](bk.#Paul) asks [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to “refresh my heart (mou ta splanchna) in [Christ](bk.#Christ).”
As [O’Brien](bio.petertobrien) 1982,\_293) remarks, “The frequent use of this word (“heart,” 7, 12, 20) shows how personally [Paul](bk.#Paul) was involved in the matter.”

## Oninēmi, “To Benefit.”

The verb oninēmi means “to benefit” or “to receive help.”
It is a hapax legomena in the NT and occurs just two times in the Septuagint ( 3:8; 30:2 LXX).
Many commentators suggest [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s word selection is a pun due to its rare use and similar sound to the name [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) (Onēsimos). [Dunn](bio.jamesdgdunn) 1996,\_341), for example, argues that [Paul](bk.#Paul) “deliberately chooses what was an unusual term for him.”
He further claims that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) would have been able to pick up on the pun since he was an educated man.
2000,\_119) and [Lohse](bio.eduardlohse) 1971,\_205), however, suggest a play on words is far from certain.
Regardless of whether [Paul](bk.#Paul) intended the play on words, [Barth](bio.markusbarth) and [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) offer a good summary of how it could be read as such: “[Paul](bk.#Paul) would ‘like’ to profit by [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1), as [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) profits from [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1), the now ‘profitable’ one” (see [Barth](bio.markusbarth) [Blanke](bio.helmutblanke) 2000,\_486).

# Application Overview

[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) provides Christians with a remarkable example of “theology in practice” in two ways.
First, although the letter lacks any of the theological arguments common to [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letters, the theology of the gospel serves as the basis of the letter.
In [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s letter to the Galatians, he writes that “there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in [Christ Jesus](bk.#Jesus)” ( 3:28).
Likewise, [Paul](bk.#Paul) writes in Colossians which he probably sent along with his letter to [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) that there is no longer “slave and free” since “[Christ](bk.#Christ) is all and in all” ( 3:11).
[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s plea for [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) to receive [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) as his brother, and not only as a slave, is thus a plea to live according to the reality of being “in [Christ](bk.#Christ).”
Second, [Paul](bk.#Paul)’s belief in the reconciling power of the gospel compels him to sacrifice his resources to ensure that [Philemon](bk.#Philemon.1) and [Onesimus](bk.#Onesimus.1) make peace with each other.
[Paul](bk.#Paul)’s desire for reconciliation and his willingness take on another’s burden are in every way Christ-like and provide a model for believers today.
